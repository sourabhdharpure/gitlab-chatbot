For example, when designing a new feature, we focus on delivering a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) first, then iteratively expanding functionality based on user feedback and data.  This allows us to quickly get value to users and adapt based on real-world usage.\n\nAnother key practice is our focus on workflow efficiency. We encourage teams to work concurrently on multiple items, ensuring that tasks aren't blocked unnecessarily.  We strive to build features that are easily integrated into existing workflows, providing clear context for each change. For instance,  new features are often designed to integrate seamlessly with our CI/CD pipelines, making them easier to adopt and use.\n\nSecurity is paramount.  We have a strong focus on application security testing, software supply chain security, and security risk management throughout our development process.  Our best practices embed security considerations from the very beginning of a project, not as an afterthought.  We continuously monitor and improve our security posture based on emerging threats and vulnerabilities.  We also work hard to make our security tools accessible and easy to use for all our users, regardless of their technical expertise.\n\n\nFinally, collaboration is central to our culture.  We utilize GitLab's own project management tools extensively \u2013 issues, merge requests, and discussions \u2013 to foster transparency and facilitate teamwork. We believe in open communication and encourage everyone to contribute their ideas and insights.\n",
