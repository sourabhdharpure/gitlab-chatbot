GitLab has recently surpassed the $150M ARR milestone, with unusually high revenue growth and retention rates. GitLab is uniquely positioned in the market with a vision to offer a single application for the entire DevSecOps lifecycle. GitLab competes across numerous market segments and aims to deliver value in 80+ market categories. GitLab’s product vision is uniquely ambitious, as we were the first DevSecOps player to take a single application approach. From idea to production, GitLab helps teams improve cycle time from weeks to minutes, reduce development process costs, and enable a faster time to market while increasing developer productivity. With software “eating the world,” this is widely viewed as a mission-critical value proposition for customers. We also have a number of tailwinds in the form of cloud adoption, Kubernetes adoption, and DevSecOps tool consolidation, which are helping fuel our rapid growth. Finally, GitLab has an open source community and distribution model, which has exposed the value of GitLab to millions of developers and has sped up the maturation of our product through more than 200 monthly improvements to the GitLab codebase from our users. Strategic challenges Tension between Breadth and Depth: Our ambitious single-application product vision means we need to build out feature function value across a very large surface area. With so much to deliver in a single application, it is a big UX challenge to keep the experience simple, consistent, and seamless between DevSecOps phases. Our challenge is to drive the right balance between breadth and depth by retaining a seed then nurture approach in new product areas while simultaneously improving existing product areas that generate usage and revenue. Shifting more focus to product depth will allow us to win and retain sophisticated enterprise customers. GitLab.com and Self-Managed: Another challenge we face is the balance between our self-managed and GitLab.com offerings. GitLab's early paying customers were more interested in self-managed, and the majority of our customers use this offering today. As a result, we focused heavily on delivering a great self-managed customer experience. However, as the market shifts toward cloud adoption, we are seeing an increasing demand for our GitLab.com offering. We now need to rapidly meet the same enterprise-grade security, reliability, and performance expectations our paying customers have come to expect from self-managed in our SaaS (.com offering). Wide Customer Profile: We also serve a wide range of customers, from individual contributor developers to large enterprises, across all vertical markets. This range of deployment options and customer sizes makes our business complex and makes it hard to optimize the customer experience for all customer sizes. Over the past few years, we have prioritized enabling our direct sales channel, but in the process have not focused enough on great customer experiences around self-service purchase workflows, onboarding, and cross-stage adoption. Competition: Finally, we have formidable competition from much larger companies, including Microsoft, Atlassian, and Synopsys to name a few. Microsoft is starting to mimic our single application positioning, and while behind us in the journey, have substantial resources to dedicate to competing with GitLab. Product Strategy Focus on increasing Stages per Organization (SpO): There is a strong correlation between the number of stages customers use and their propensity to upgrade to a paid package. In fact, adding a stage triples conversion! Each product group should be laser-focused on driving adoption and regular usage of their respective stages, as it should lead to higher Net ARR, reduced churn, and higher customer satisfaction. As outlined in this user journey, the most important additional stages for customers to adopt are Create to Verify and Verify to Release, as each of these adoption steps open up three additional stages to users. Harness the unique power of a single application: GitLab’s primary point of differentiation is our single application approach. As we continue to drive value in any given stage or category, our first instinct should be to connect that feature or product experience to other parts of the GitLab product. These cross-stage connections will drive differentiated customer value and will be impossible for point product competitors to imitate. Recognizing this opportunity, we have grown our R&D organization significantly over the past two years, and plan to invest an outsized amount on R&D for the next 2-3 years to extend our lead in executing against the single application product vision. Increase wider-community contributions: To achieve this ambitious vision more quickly, we will leverage our powerful open source community. Each stage should have a clear strategy for tiering the value of the stage. When stages are early in maturity, we will bias toward including as much functionality in our Core open source version as possible, to drive more rapid adoption and greater community contributions, which will",

    "content": "additional stages for customers to adopt are Create to Verify and Verify to Release, as each of these adoption steps open up three additional stages to users. Harness the unique power of a single application: GitLab’s primary point of differentiation is our single application approach. As we continue to drive value in any given stage or category, our first instinct should be to connect that feature or product experience to other parts of the GitLab product. These cross-stage connections will drive differentiated customer value and will be impossible for point product competitors to imitate. Recognizing this opportunity, we have grown our R&D organization significantly over the past two years, and plan to invest an outsized amount on R&D for the next 2-3 years to extend our lead in executing against the single application product vision. Increase wider-community contributions: To achieve this ambitious vision more quickly, we will leverage our powerful open source community. Each stage should have a clear strategy for tiering the value of the stage. When stages are early in maturity, we will bias toward including as much functionality in our Core open source version as possible, to drive more rapid adoption and greater community contributions, which will help us mature new stages faster. Once stage adoption is achieved, we can then layer on additional value in paid tiers to encourage upgrades. Make our core journey categories complete: We want to ensure the core product usage experience is great, which will lead to more paying customers and improved customer retention. We intend to maintain our market-leading depth in stages with complete categories, which currently are Verify (Continuous Integration) and Create (Source Code Management and Code Review). Beyond that, we will endeavor to rapidly mature our offering to complete in Plan (3rd most used stage), Release (4th most used stage), and Secure (important element of our Ultimate tier). GitLab-hosted first: Most customers don't want to run GitLab themselves (self-managed), so we should build out the offerings where we do it for them (GitLab-hosted). GitLab-hosted includes our SaaS (GitLab.com), any single-tenant offerings, and other GitLab hosted services that self-managed installations can use. Our customer and revenue growth rate for our SaaS offering is faster than our self-managed offering. To meet growing customer demand, our SaaS offering needs to have enterprise-grade security, availability, and performance. We must also ensure feature parity between self-managed and SaaS and that customers have an easy migration path from self-managed to SaaS. Going forward, all new features should be available on SaaS when they are available on self-managed, if not before. We will also begin offering GitLab-hosted services to self-managed customers to provide additional value that may not be feasible to deliver in a self-managed environment, e.g. automated cloud backups. Finally, we expect to offer different GitLab-hosted deployment options for single tenant customers and specific geographic regions to meet the regulatory, security, and data residency requirements of various customer segments. Fiscal year product investment themes Every year at GitLab, we choose some specific areas of emphasis to help guide the teams on the areas of our product that we want to accentuate. This section is used to highlight that emphasis. It is not a comprehensive list of everything we plan to do this year. Direction for each stage and category can be found at the respective direction pages. We are not asking the teams to deviate from their core mission. Many teams will see themselves contributing to these areas of emphasis directly. The other teams will continue to execute on their mission - that is also important. The themes are to help facilitate cross-team collaboration when invariably teams working on the 1-year themes may need to collaborate with others. Our guidance is: if any team approaches you to prioritize something that is thematic for this year, consider that as a higher priority than you would normally - as it is in service of the broader product-wide goal that we, as a company, have deemed important to accomplish this year. See Product Investment (internal handbook page) for how we allocate our R&D investment across our product hierarchy. FY26 Key Principles Driving Themes Usability: Users are telling us that we need to better meet their expectations and make the experience more intuitive. Depth: We need to stop doing some of the things we are doing today. Customers are asking us to improve core functionality through usability improvements and remove half-completed features. Data Quality: Without more visibility, we cannot make as many data-driven decisions. And neither can our customers. We need to complete our data unification effort to make this easier. Deployment Parity: All three deployments (GitLab.com, GitLab Dedicated, Self-Managed) will have feature parity (with the exception of “admin area” topics on .com and Dedicated). R&D Investment Themes For FY26, the four key R&D investment themes we are focused on are: Win with DevSecOps platform completeness Differentiate with AI across the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Lead with SDLC insights and reporting Elevate customer-centricity to customer obsession Win with DevSecOps platform completeness We will focus primarily on core DevSecOps platform capabilities across SCM, CI, CD, security, compliance, and enterprise agile planning with the goal to achieve a leadership position or extend our existing leadership position. We will drive Premium and Ultimate value by helping propel free-to-paid conversion through product-led growth / feature discovery moments. Differentiate with AI across the SDLC We will introduce new as well as improve existing GitLab Duo AI capabilities within our core DevSecOps platform capabilities. We will also bring ModelOps features to general availability, including a focus on enabling customers to work with native data science workloads within GitLab. Lead with SDLC insights and reporting We will focus on deepening the types, and quality of metrics, as well as pulling metrics from third party integrations, with the goal of making GitLab the central component to understanding SDLC insights. We will also provide reporting of feature usage enabling customers to understand what features and capabilities are being used by their teams as well as what usage",

Elevate customer-centricity to customer obsession We will focus on addressing use case adoption issues as well as improving user experience within onboarding to improve our customer's time-to-value for core DevSecOps platform capabilities. We will improve customer experience improve ease-of-use for SMB/commercial customers with license management and self-service workflows. Based upon and informed by the pricing research completed in FY25, we will also implement an updated pricing strategy. FY25 Key Principles Driving Themes Depth over Breadth: For the past several years we have focused on breadth over depth. This has allowed us to show our direction as a company and define the DevOps Platform market. In FY24, we pivoted to depth over breadth as product depth allows us to win and retain sophisticated enterprise customers. We will continue our focus on depth throughout FY25. Drive Adoption of Ultimate: Due to the increasing demands for security and compliance in software development, GitLab Ultimate continues to gain popularity with our customers. We will focus on increasing the value of Ultimate by not only improving security and compliance functionality but also adding value from other key areas within our platform like Plan, Verify, and Data Science. Differentiate: Our primary point of differentiation is our single application approach: all aspects of our DevSecOps platform work seamlessly together, right out of the box, and can be tailored to the specific needs of each organization. R&D Investment Themes For FY25, the four key R&D investment themes we are focused on are: Enable AI/ML Efficiencies Across DevSecOps Drive Use Case Adoption to Fully Realize Value Differentiate on DevSecOps Platform Strengthen Our SaaS Deployments & Capabilities Enable AI/ML Efficiencies Across DevSecOps AI as part of software development has continued to mature and has become the number one topic in our customer discussions. To meet our customers’ needs and the evolving market landscape, we will take a three pronged approach to AI (GitLab Duo, ModelOps, AI agents) as part of our DevSecOps platform providing us differentiation in the market. Drive Use Case Adoption to Fully Realize Value CI and CD are critical to the success of Premium, while security and governance drives value in Ultimate. We will increase our focus on adoption of these areas - ensuring that customers realize the value of the capabilities they have paid for. This will continue to reduce churn, drive free-to-paid conversion, and increase up-tiering from Premium to Ultimate. Differentiate on DevSecOps Platform Toolchain consolidation continues to come up with customers as well as in our annual DevSecOps survey. We will capitalize on our position as the enterprise DevSecOps platform by continuing to expand our planning capabilities, continuing to mature our metrics and reporting, and bring new SCM capabilities to general availability. Strengthen Our SaaS Deployments & Capabilities GitLab.com and GitLab Dedicated continue to grow in popularity as more organizations need to undergo digital transformations however do not want the overhead of self-hosting their DevSecOps platform. We expect this trend to continue in FY25 and will invest in our SaaS deployments to ensure they meet our customers’ expectations. DevSecOps stages DevSecOpsPlanCodeBuildTestReleaseDeployOperateMonitorSecurityCompliance DevSecOps is a broad space with a lot of complexity. To manage this within GitLab, we break down the DevSecOps lifecycle into a few different sections, each with its own direction page you can review. Dev Section Direction - Includes the Plan and Create stages CI Section Direction - Includes the Verify and Package stages CD Section Direction - Includes the Deploy stage, which includes the Environments group Sec Section Direction - Includes the Software Supply Chain Security Direction and the Application Security Testing, Software Supply Chain Security, and Security Risk Management stages Data Science Section Direction - Includes the ModelOps stage, which includes the MLOps and DataOps groups AI Section Direction - Includes the AI-powered stage, which includes the AI Framework, Duo Chat, Agent Foundations, Code Creation, Custom Models, Editor Extensions, Global Search, and Workflow Catalog groups Analytics Section Direction - Includes the Analytics stage, which includes the Analytics Instrumentation, Platform Insights, and Optimize groups Growth Section Direction - Includes the Growth stage, which includes the Engagement, Acquisition, and Activation groups Fulfillment Section Direction - Includes the Fulfillment stage, which includes the Provision, Utilization, Fulfillment Platform, Subscription Management, and Seat Management groups Foundations Section Direction - Includes the Foundations stage, which includes the Design System, UX Paper Cuts, and Accessibility groups Tenant Scale Section Direction - Includes the Data Access and Runtime stages GitLab Delivery Section Direction - Includes the GitLab Delivery stage, which includes the GitLab Build, Operate, and Release and Deploy groups Production Engineering Section Direction - Includes the Production Engineering stage, which includes the Runway, Networking and Incident Management, Observability, and Runners Platform groups GitLab Dedicated Section Direction - Includes the GitLab Dedicated stage,",

These community contributions are an important part our company mission and strategy. Our issue tracker contains requests made for features and changes to GitLab. Contributing is the best way to get a feature you want included as we continually merge code to be released in the next version. Please see our Contribute to GitLab page for more details such as guides to get started contributing, areas looking for contributions, and contribution acceptance criteria. Personas Personas are the people we design for. Developers, security professionals, and operations professionals are currently the primary personas we focus on, and we tailor our user experience to their needs. We want GitLab to be the main interface for people in these roles, so they can show up at work, start their day, and load up GitLab. And that’s already happening. But there are a lot of other roles involved with the development and delivery of software. That is the ultimate GitLab goal - where everyone involved with software development and delivery uses a single application so they are on the same page with the rest of their team. We are rapidly expanding our user experience for Designers, Compliance Managers, Product Managers, and Release Managers. We’ll also be expanding to the business side, with Executive visibility and reporting. While we’re still calling it DevSecOps, we’re really expanding the definition of DevSecOps and delivering it all as a single application. Mitigating low-end disruption GitLab is not immune to disruption. In some ways, it is a sign of success that GitLab is now at a scale where we have to think about low-end disruption. Arguably, a few years ago, GitLab was a low-end disruptor. Clayton Christensen defines low-end-disruption as follows: Low-end disruption refers to businesses that come in at the bottom of the market and serve customers in a way that is \"good enough.\" These are generally the lower profit markets for the incumbent and thus, when these new businesses enter, the incumbents move further \"upstream.\" In other words, they put their focus on where the greater profit margins are. Our perspective is that low-end disruption is an additional and critical sensing mechanism. This is especially true for the DevSecOps market. We look at the following attributes to figure out if a low-end disruption has anything close to potential product-market resonance. This list is an adaptation of the Product Zeitgeist Fit. Builder Enthusiasm: Are the most talented, hardest working, or most-in-demand people - the engineers, the developers - so intrigued by the approach that they are working on it, excited by it, and trying to make it a thing? If that is the case, then there is a good chance that they will eventually make it happen, moving beyond the fringes to the mainstream. Number of stars, forks, and contributions in the repo are some metrics to look for here. Despite Test: When people are using a product despite the fact that it’s not the best thing out there, or, in some cases, that it’s straight-up terrible, it’s a great sign. It shows that the product has a line into something emotional, not solely functional. Wanted, not just needed. In the early days, these products can often feel misunderstood or controversial. At first blush, the conceit may even raise a few eyebrows. But to the people who have been working on those products, they’re so clearly elegant, if temporarily imperfect, solutions to big and important problems that they seem almost obvious once they recognize it. Google Trends and posts on Hacker News are some things to monitor here. T-shirt Test: If people with no connection to the company are wearing their t-shirts or putting their stickers on their laptops or wearing their socks, that desire to associate with the idea indicates as much a movement as a product. A reason low-end disruptors are able to enter the market is that the feature-absorption by users is lower than the feature-velocity of the established vendor. To address this we are focused on a working-by-default configuration principle. Maturity As we add new categories and stages to GitLab, some areas of the product will be deeper and more mature than others. We publish a list of the categories, what we think their maturity levels are, and our plans to improve on our categories page. We strive to be the best product in the market and to be complete.

Maturity As we add new categories and stages to GitLab, some areas of the product will be deeper and more mature than others. We publish a list of the categories, what we think their maturity levels are, and our plans to improve on our categories page. We strive to be the best product in the market and to be complete. As the market, customer needs, competitive landscape, and technology change, we should expect our maturities to also change, including changing to a lower maturity rating. By embracing a focus on improvement and low level of shame, we encourage moving a maturity down. This is a strong indicator that we are realists about our product with an eye on achieving the best results for our customers. Scope We try to prevent maintaining functionality that is language or platform specific, because they slow down our ability to get results. Examples of how we handle it instead are: We don't make native mobile clients. Instead, we make sure our mobile web pages are great. We don't make native clients for desktop operating systems. We make our web application great—for example, GitLab was the first to have merge conflict resolution in our web application. People can also use Tower or other clients. For language translations, we rely on the wider community. For code navigation, we're hesitant to introduce navigation improvements that only work for a subset of languages. For building and testing with Auto DevOps, we use Heroku Buildpacks. Outside our scope are Kubernetes and everything it depends on: Network (fabric) Flannel, Openflow, VMware NSX, Cisco ACI Proxy (layer 7) Envoy, nginx, HAProxy, traefik Ingress (north/south) Contour, Ambassador, Service mesh (east/west) Istio, Linkerd Container Scheduler we mainly focus on Kubernetes, other container schedulers are: CloudFoundry, OpenStack, OpenShift, Mesos DCOS, Docker Swarm, Atlas/Terraform, Nomad, Deis, Convox, Flynn, Tutum, GiantSwarm, Rancher Package manager Helm, ksonnet Operating System Ubuntu, CentOS, RHEL, CoreOS, Alpine Linux During a presentation of Kubernetes, Brendan Burns talks about the four Ops layers at the 2:00 mark: Application Ops Cluster Ops Kernel/OS Ops Hardware Ops GitLab helps you mainly with application ops. And where needed, we also allow you to monitor clusters and link them to application environments. But we intend to use vanilla Kubernetes, instead of something specific to GitLab. Also outside our scope are products that are not specific to developing, securing, or operating applications and digital products. Identity management: Okta and Duo, you use this mainly with SaaS applications you don't develop, secure, or operate. SaaS integration: Zapier and IFTTT Ecommerce: Shopify In scope are things that are not mainly for SaaS applications: Network security, since it overlaps with application security to some extent. Security information and event management (SIEM), since that measures applications and network. Office productivity applications, since \"We believe that all digital products should be open to contributions, from legal documents to movie scripts and from websites to chip designs\" We expect GitLab to continue to grow, and we have several ideas for possible future stages Quarterly Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) To make sure our goals are clearly defined and aligned throughout the organization, we make use of OKRs (Objectives and Key Results). Our quarterly Objectives and Key Results are publicly viewable. How we plan releases At GitLab, we strive to be ambitious, maintain a strong sense of urgency, and set aspirational targets with every release. The direction items we highlight in our kickoff are a reflection of this ambitious planning. When it comes to execution, we aim for velocity over predictability. This way, we optimize our planning time to focus on the top of the queue and deliver things fast. We schedule 100% of what we can accomplish based on past Development Department merge request rate and availability factors (vacation, contribute, etc.). See our product handbook on how we prioritize. Previous releases On our releases page, you can find an overview of the most important features of recent releases and links to the blog posts for each release. Upcoming releases GitLab releases a new version every single month. You can find the major planned features for upcoming releases on our upcoming releases page or see the upcoming features for paid tiers. Note that we often move things around, do things that are not listed, and cancel things that are listed. ML/AI at GitLab With Gitlab 15.4, Suggested Reviewers was released as our first customer-facing ML/AI technology in production features. We have additional ambitions in the near future for several types of problems. This is the focus of our new ModelOps stage. Cross-Stage efforts GitLab consistently strives to deliver a cohesive experience that enables workflows that span the DevSecOps loop. We have a number of existing capabilities and planned improvements that do just that: TBA Footnotes IDC, Worldwide DevOps Software Tools Forecast, 2020–2024, Doc # US45188520, July 2020 Edit this page View source",

Please use #doe-ops or other public channels for topics that don’t require confidentiality. Meetings Zoom Recordings synced to Google Drive GitLab encourages transparency by default, and when meetings are recorded, they can be automatically synced to Google Drive as highlighted in the section about how we conduct video calls at GitLab. To summarize: Record meetings to the cloud in Zoom, and add the text [REC] anywhere in the meeting title (e.g. Google calendar event) It will automatically be added to the GitLab Videos Recorded folder on Google Drive, with a naming convention of youremail-Meeting Title. After a meeting ends, Zoom may take some time to process the recording before it is actually available. The sync to Google Drive happens on the hour mark, so if the recording is not available, it may take another hour to be transferred. Future recordings of recurring meetings can be found in the same folder youremail-Meeting Title, even if alternate hosts start the recording. Ops Engineering Showcase Starting in 2023 in FY24-Q1, a fresh new format for this showcase will include the recording and sharing of videos that team members have created. Once a video has been created, an async discussion issue should be created using this template and listed under the relevant quarterly epic. Based on the amount of questions being discussed in the issue, an AMA may be set up to discuss further in a group setting. Like before, these videos are intended to be opportunities for engineers to show off the things they’ve been working on. Beginning in March 2023 all Ops teams are required to provide at least one showcase video and async discussion issue per month. We require participation in this process because it helps reinforce our values of Results, Transparency, and Iteration. In addition, these showcases are valuable in helping team members across the company better understand the progress and obstacles across the many product areas Ops team members are focused on. They are also fun to watch. These videos will be reviewed monthly by the Director of Engineering and other leaders in the group. The team’s Engineering Manager is the DRI for submitting the showcase, though in many cases the demo may be delegated to another member of the team. Team members are encouraged to use these videos to transparently showcase the current state of their projects. It is not encouraged to spend significant time prepping for these demos or only showcase finished, polished functionality; showing functionality in an incomplete state is encouraged. Videos may be specifically recorded for this purpose or be excerpts from team meetings, etc. Some suggested ideas to consider could be related to error budget improvements, performance improvements to current features, refactoring to codebase for future maintainability, etc. Ops Engineering Showcases Recordings Past Recordings Quarterly Recordings NOTE: - changed to monthly recordings in FY24-Q3.

Planning Processes Planning processes followed by teams in the Sub-department: General Ops Sub-department Planning Process Forced Priority planning/scheduling Our prioritization framework describes a number of Forced Priority labels that present a high risk to our customers and our business. As such, it’s critical that we complete this work within the appropriate SLO/SLAs where possible. An example of this are security issues, here’s a dashboard for past due and soon to be due security issues: https://10az.online.tableau.com/t/gitlab/views/DRAFTIssueTypesDetail/PastDueIssueList/d1401498-2050-4321-b0f4-ab51047fbeb1/1909fa14-fdf0-4682-8a07-f02d8c8d4803 With this in mind, here’s a process that groups are encouraged to use and iterate on in the event that they don’t have an existing approach or are falling behind on SLA/SLOs. To be clear, this is not a required process, if your group’s approach is working, please continue with that! Ownership of scheduling forced priority work falls on our whole team, not a particular person. When forced priority issues are assigned to your group, schedule those issues right away regardless of severity label Have the team review the issue to make sure there’s a viable solution and plan (weight the issue) Have someone in the group assign themselves to work on the issue Update the issue regularly with progress Treat blockers with the same or higher priority than the original issue Sustaining / Non-Sustaining planning exercise In FY23, each EM in Ops was asked to participate in a capacity planning exercise that involved evaluating the sustaining vs non-sustaining work in their team’s backlog. This exercise was also repeated by the Verify Pipeline teams in FY24 to better understand Engineering capacity needs for each of the Pipeline teams. Each team created a staffing justification based on the breakdown of sustaining vs non-sustaining issues in their backlog. EMs estimated the number of backend engineers and frontend engineers that would be needed, per quarter, of the given fiscal year to burndown these issues, as ordered by the prioritization framework and relevant priority/severity labels. Sustaining work Sustaining work refers to the most important security, availability, scalability and performance, essential for “keeping the lights on” for the feature categories the team supports. Capacity planning for sustaining work was based on meeting the SLO/SLAs of these types of issues. The labels for sustaining work include, but are not limited to: bug::vulnerability (note: specifically this label, as an issue with only a security label does not make it a security vulnerability) bug::availability bug::performance infradev Non-Sustaining work Non-sustaining effort refers to all other work the teams would work on, including: type::feature type::maintenance (e.g. technical debt that does not impact availability, scalability, performance, etc) all other type::bug issues not covered as sustaining work reviewing community contributions responding to customer inquiries / support requests Ops Promotion Process Tips for writing Promotion Documents The format and guidelines are as listed in this Google Doc template Results is our most important value to cover in promotion docs, especially at Staff+ levels. This should be short (making it succinct can be easier to understand), but descriptive enough to show the impact these results have had. Impact should also be highlighted (quantifiable where possible), with examples such as: customer-facing impact (CMAU, ARR growth, retention, adoption, etc) improvements in efficiency, team process or other team metrics Examples demonstrating leadership, ownership and accountability (going above and beyond for your current role): Your role on a project or initiative (“how did you successfully help deliver X?”, “what role did you play in this Working Group?”) MR Review efforts (your role as a maintainer for your team or for the rest of the department in your domain) Collaborating with your team’s stable counterparts Mentoring/coaching others on your team or outside your team (e.g. participation in mentorship programs, coaching in MRs as a reviewer/maintainer) Influencing your team’s technical direction or contributions to more strategic discussions For Staff+ engineers: this could mean authoring or contributing to architectural design documents or leading technical discussions with your team or driving cross-stage collaboration Involvement in recruiting efforts (e.g. as an interviewer and/or reviewer of the technical assessment) Examples of promotion documents from previously approved Ops promotions can be found in this Google Drive folder Promotion Document Reviews Team Member and Manager work together to create promotion document. Promotion document is shared with Ops Sub-Department managers in #ops-staff-confidential channel (private to Ops Managers, Senior Managers, Director) to receive feedback on the document content and how it calibrates with others in the Sub-Department. This can be done early and often. Manager requests another Manager in the Sub-Department review and approve the document. Manager requests Senior Manager in the Sub-Department review and approve the document. Manager requests Director add Team Member to list of Sub-Department planned promotions. If the team member cannot be added Director will provide feedback to Manager as to why. Director presents promotion doc at Development Department quarterly promotion review meeting. If the promotion is not approved Director will provide feedback to Manager as to why. Quarterly Promotion Review Meeting Ops Managers, Sr. Managers, and Directors meet in the last month of each quarter to: Review promotion projections for each group. Managers add a list of their direct reports who they anticipate will be ready for promotion in the next 3 quarters to the meeting agenda. Note these lists may change and are not a guarantee a team member will be promoted in a specific quarter. The lists are used for planning purposes, to help us anticipate the number of team members approaching promotion, budget impact, and to support calibration across the group. These lists should include: Team Member name Targeted promotion quarter",

Manager requests Senior Manager in the Sub-Department review and approve the document. Manager requests Director add Team Member to list of Sub-Department planned promotions. If the team member cannot be added Director will provide feedback to Manager as to why. Director presents promotion doc at Development Department quarterly promotion review meeting. If the promotion is not approved Director will provide feedback to Manager as to why. Quarterly Promotion Review Meeting Ops Managers, Sr. Managers, and Directors meet in the last month of each quarter to: Review promotion projections for each group. Managers add a list of their direct reports who they anticipate will be ready for promotion in the next 3 quarters to the meeting agenda. Note these lists may change and are not a guarantee a team member will be promoted in a specific quarter. The lists are used for planning purposes, to help us anticipate the number of team members approaching promotion, budget impact, and to support calibration across the group. These lists should include: Team Member name Targeted promotion quarter Link to promotion doc Whether the doc has received any Ops Manager or Ops Senior Manager approvals. Review Ops team member promotion docs planned to be presented at Development Department quarterly promotion review meeting. Promotion Mentor for Staff+ Roles Team members who aspire to advance within our organization are advised to identify a mentor in the targeted role, and reach out to them about a mentorship. Involving a mentor in the peer promotion review process is beneficial, as it ensures: The feedback is informed by comprehensive understanding and relevance to the individual’s development. The feedback, being familiar and constructive, will not catch the mentee off guard and will provide clear directions for improvement from peers they’d work with directly. Individuals pursuing promotion, possibly in consultation with their managers, should maintain regular communication with their mentor to evaluate progress and explore further opportunities for growth. This initiative also aims to cultivate leadership qualities among our senior Staff+ engineers. We plan to trial this optional process in Ops during Q1FY25. Progress and established mentor/mentee pairs can be found in this epic Ops Hiring process We have limited capacity in the recruiting team so hiring managers are experimenting with the Ops Hiring process. We also hold a weekly hiring manager sync meeting (see Meetings section). Objectives & Key Results (OKRs) Creating OKRs Target a 70% completion rate for OKRs so that we are setting goals ambitiously. They should be challenging enough that accomplishing 100% is a stretch goal,since GitLab considers OKRs to be stretch goals by default. If your OKRs are associated with any specific types of issues, consider reviewing the prioritization framework, and align with your team on your OKRs priority relative to one another (for example, OKRs with issues with “forced prioritization”) and be clear on planning of the associated work over the quarter. Ensure Key Results (KRs) are measurable, by specifying a number (% or unit) as the target. Be clear on the starting number, and the expected end result (e.g. from x to y). Ideally create no more than 9 KRs per quarter, ideally with approximately 3 KR per objective. Tracking and completing OKRs Tracking quarterly OKRs for Ops Engineering groups. DRIs are expected to score OKRs on a regular basis, at least monthly, if possible. At the end of the quarter, DRIs can add a retrospective as a comment to reflect on the progress of their KR, in the following format: **Good** - Things that went well... **Bad** - Things that didn't go so well... **Try** - What might you do differently next time? Key Projects For projects that span many milestones we are experimenting with additional project management processes.

Charts look great and are thoroughly tested, instrumented. We'll show usage dashboards. Release end of week. Updates to the plan should be made weekly, marking weekly items done and making updates based on current information. Authors should merge updates to their project plans without review/approval. We expect the use of project plans to reduce the amount of EM reporting by serving as a SSOT for project execution planning. For example this info no longer needs to be included in async updates (replace with a link to project plan). Key Project Review Meetings We hold periodic sync meetings to review key projects and collaborate on the plans for these important deliverables. Key Project DRIs should prepare for the meeting by creating a Key Project Review Prep Issue. This should be completed and shared at least 48 hours in advance of the meeting to allow time for other team members to review the content. The objective is to keep these meetings focused on execution, technical planning, and accountability within the Engineering group. These are open to anyone who wishes to attend. When it’s necessary to involve a broader group in some cases, we can plan additional follow ups case by case. We aim to meet synchronously where possible given the benefits of being able to talk through the project in a higher bandwidth context. Rescheduling is preferred if the proposed dates are not feasible for attendees. We could re-evaluate whether we can achieve the same goals with async after we have more experience running the process. The focus of the meeting time will be on topics such as: Do we all understand the goals, plan, and timeline? Obstacles/risks and mitigation plans Unmet dependencies Staffing levels Competing priorities How to unblock and/or accelerate Recognizing progress and key team member contributions Async Updates (No Status In Meetings) We have a policy in Ops to keep status updates out of meetings. Instead of reporting on status in meetings Directors, Senior Engineering Managers, Engineering Managers and Principal Engineers provide regular async updates. The content of these updates varies by individual and role: Async Update Guidance Engineering Manager Cadence: Weekly to Monthly (Optional) Topics: Highlights & Accomplishments Team Projects & Priorities (progress, blockers, key decisions, etc.) What’s next - what to expect in next update Senior Engineering Manager Cadence: Monthly (Optional) Topics: Milestone Review Allocation of focus in milestone plans (major features, maintenance, etc.) What tradeoffs or decisions should be made prior to Milestone kickoff? For example: Is the team overcommitted? Does the allocation of effort need to shift to meet specific goals? (e.g. Security SLAs) Principal Engineer Cadence: Weekly (Optional) Topics: Highlights & Accomplishments Projects & Priorities (progress, blockers, key decisions, etc.) To create a weekly async update Create a GitLab issue in any project. Apply the label ~OpsSection::AsyncUpdate. (The label ~OpsSection::Weekly-Update can also be used for backwards compatibility reasons.) Choose a descriptive title. Include your update in the issue description. To HIGHLIGHT an item for broader sharing Begin any paragraph in your update with the text HIGHLIGHT: These paragraphs will automatically be copied into the Highlights & Accomplishments section of the monthly Director’s update. To review Ops weekly async updates All issues with the ~OpsSection::AsyncUpdate or ~OpsSection::Weekly-Update label are summarized in weekly issues in the Ops Status Updates project. All team members are encouraged to comment and ask questions in weekly async update issues. This provides useful feedback to the author and opportunities to collaborate. Director reviews all updates weekly (from the prior week) and provides feedback. Senior EMs reviews all updates from their teams weekly (from the prior week) and provides feedback. Benefits of reporting and reviewing status async vs. synchronously in meetings Collaboration - By sharing announcements, achievements, goals, and plans we are empowering team members with the information they need to make sound decisions and succeed in their roles. Results - Async updates provide an important channel for sharing accomplishments and progress. Efficiency - Expecting each team member to poll for the status they need is extremely inefficient and becomes more inefficient as the organization grows. By using a Publish Subscribe model we are able to share information much more efficiently. Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging - Async status is more inclusive of team members across timezones. Not every team member will be able to make a sync meeting (due to timezone or other factors) but everyone can participate in an async update. Iteration - Taking the time to checkpoint where we are at each week prompts the author and readers to consider ways to iterate and to reflect on incremental progress. Transparency - Sharing information in a consistent, accessible way increases transparency and reduces the threshold for team members to contribute. Escalations from Support Team We are piloting a process to make coordinating with the Support team on customer escalations more efficient. See How to Use GitLab.com to Formally Request Help from the GitLab Ops Development Team for process details. If you encounter an Ops-related customer escalation,",

    "content": "information they need to make sound decisions and succeed in their roles. Results - Async updates provide an important channel for sharing accomplishments and progress. Efficiency - Expecting each team member to poll for the status they need is extremely inefficient and becomes more inefficient as the organization grows. By using a Publish Subscribe model we are able to share information much more efficiently. Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging - Async status is more inclusive of team members across timezones. Not every team member will be able to make a sync meeting (due to timezone or other factors) but everyone can participate in an async update. Iteration - Taking the time to checkpoint where we are at each week prompts the author and readers to consider ways to iterate and to reflect on incremental progress. Transparency - Sharing information in a consistent, accessible way increases transparency and reduces the threshold for team members to contribute. Escalations from Support Team We are piloting a process to make coordinating with the Support team on customer escalations more efficient. See How to Use GitLab.com to Formally Request Help from the GitLab Ops Development Team for process details. If you encounter an Ops-related customer escalation, that seems to have a high customer priority, and would benefit from additional visibility, please post a link with a short description in #doe-ops Slack channel. Supporting Customers on Dedicated instances When teams are asked to triage support requests for customers on GitLab Dedicated and engineers need access to their logs, a sync can be arranged between the engineer and the assigned Support Engineer for a screen sharing session. However, when further troubleshooting is needed by the engineering team or async collaboration is preferred, follow these steps to request access: Create an access request (AR) and list the engineers who require access. (Note that EMs can create this issue and provide Manager Approval on behalf of the engineers) Assign the AR to the EM and PM of the Dedicated group for read-only log access. Reference the AR issue in the support tracker issue so that the Support Engineer is aware.

    "title": "Office of the CEO | The GitLab Handbook",
    "content": "Office of the CEO Details about Office of the CEO (OCEO) at GitLab Office of the CEO Overview GitLab is a functionally organized company in which functions are as mutually exclusive as possible to be efficient. Without a COO or central operating department reporting into the CEO, the CEO gets leverage through an Office of the CEO (OCEO for short) led by the Chief of Staff (CoS) to the CEO. While the Chief of Staff to the CEO is not a part of GitLab’s executive team, this senior person reports directly to the CEO and manages a team that supports the CEO and/or cross-functional projects of importance to GitLab. Team Mission Help the CEO be more effective and lead select cross-functional initiatives of importance to GitLab. Team Composition The Office to the CEO consists of: The Chief of Staff to the CEO: the person responsible for running this group and supporting the success of the CEO. Strategy and Operations team members: internal consultants and doers who support priority cross-functional projects within GitLab. Roles vary based on business needs, but these folks can be specialists (for example, focused on China or technology) or generalists. When there are gaps, the Office may expand to include additional roles and responsibilities. For example, at times this Office has included our TeamOps initiative, internal communications, and handbook maintenance. As GitLab is a functionally organized company, the goal in most cases is to own an area until another function is prepared to own and support it. The size of the team and which positions are present have varied over time depending on CEO priorities and required resources. For a list of current OCEO team members, please refer to the company team page. Kinds of projects Strategy and Operations team members work on Given the cross-functional nature of the company goals and given these projects are important to the CEO, the Strategy and Operators team members are often involved in these initiatives. Project Criteria The Chief of Staff to the CEO and their team may work on projects that fit any combination of the following: projects which build or improve organizational design, infrastructure, and operations cross-functional projects that need ownership until a maintainer or exit criteria is identified projects that are so broad that they can’t live within a function but are too much work for the CEO or Chief of Staff to the CEO projects that are important to the CEO This is not an exhaustive list of the types of work the Office of the CEO might do. Many Functional GitLab is a functional organization, which means the people are organized by function. When a cross-functional project arises between multiple different Departments, Office of the CEO team members may be included to help with the planning and execution. In many cases, a member of the Office of the CEO will be the directly responsible individual (DRI) for the project. Whether it’s a product feature proposal, a new initiative roll-out, or questions from the board, the Office of the CEO is the group that can be trusted to get things done, get them done quickly, and get them done right. Examples of a cross-functional project: Helping shepherd KPI and/or OKR progress Helping to launch a foreign entity Supporting pricing and packaging change initiatives Efforts to increase customer use case adoption Providing guidance around how to use GitLab’s internal handbook Under-resourced Projects come up that are both important and under-resourced. The Strategy and Operations team members within the Office of the CEO should be known for its ability to become 80% effective on any subject quickly. They are generalists at their core and, while they bring special skills to the table, they are meant to be able to address important problems as they come up. A member of the Office of the CEO might help source candidates for a strategic hire, fix grammatical errors in the handbook, and build a financial model all in the same day based on what is important or top of mind for the CEO at a given point. The team helps with work that other teams may not have the bandwidth to do but is important to the organization and/or the CEO. Examples of an under-resourced project: Creating materials for a keynote the CEO will deliver in a rushed timeline Supporting planning for a global conference Supporting launch of a new SKU No clear leader There may be projects with no clear leader for a myriad of reasons, including that we’re still hiring the point person or the lead is on leave. Because of the team’s ability to come up to speed quickly, they may be tasked with something totally out of their domain with the expectation that they bring their leadership experience to the table, will do the work to make good decisions, and will lean on team members who are subject-matter experts. For example, there has historically been no DRI for the handbook or related content sites. As it became clear that this was a GitLab priority, but no function planned to prioritize this within the coming year, the Office of the CEO stepped in to take on handbook ownership until an owner could be identified. Examples of projects with no clear leader: Managing our ongoing relationship with JiHu in China Stepping in to fill a senior level role in another function in a temporary capacity Broad Some projects or initiatives are very broad and cross-functional and make sense to belong to the CEO but would be inefficient uses of the CEO’s time if fully owned by the CEO. The Office of the CEO is the shepherd for these sorts of projects and collaborates with all team members at GitLab to achieve success on such initiatives. Examples of broad projects: E-group offsite prep Board meeting prep OKR shepherding Planning activities on behalf of the CEO Important to the CEO The CEO will have other projects that come up that they will task the Office of the CEO with, such as",

The Office of the CEO is the shepherd for these sorts of projects and collaborates with all team members at GitLab to achieve success on such initiatives. Examples of broad projects: E-group offsite prep Board meeting prep OKR shepherding Planning activities on behalf of the CEO Important to the CEO The CEO will have other projects that come up that they will task the Office of the CEO with, such as following up on something or carrying on a conversation on their behalf. Examples of tasks or initiatives that are important to the CEO: Handbook MRs Values updates Preparing for calls Special projects. These have included: Operationalizing charitable donations Supporting updates to GitLab’s expense policy Quantifying the value of transparency Auditing training resources and creating an accessible source of truth Calculating GitLab’s carbon emissions and leading a first iteration of a carbon reduction initiative Identifying the underlying reasons for why we didn’t meet targets for a core GTM KPI and identifying optimizations Supporting an initiative to increase customer CI adoption Serving as the DRI for the SaaS free user initiative How to Work Many of the tasks are quick asks: handbook MRs, formatting changes, or questions to be answered. Small asks should be handled as quickly as possible. Other asks, such as OKR-related planning or an initiative that requires alignment with multiple stakeholders, require forethought and more appropriate timing. Some amount of time each week needs to be spent moving these sorts of tasks forward. As a rule, everything in the doc is a TODO for the Office of the CEO. When tasks are DONE, they should be labeled as such. The CEO will review and delete the item once it’s been assessed as completed. Prioritization Since the team has limited capacity to lean into everything that it may want or be asked to, it is thoughtful about team and individual capacity. Members of the Office of the CEO will be expected to manage both directed and leadership (largely self-directed) work. You can find definitions and examples of directed and leadership work on the CoS to the CEO handbook page. When newly initiated, self-directed, leadership work entails a significant time commitment (>20% capacity for more than a week), the work being done should be flagged to the CEO in a 1:1 or team meeting. This work should stay on the 1:1 agenda between the CoS to the CEO and the team member for the duration of the activity. If needed, activities may be reprioritized based on top demands and priorities. More senior roles within the Office of the CEO can expect to have more leadership than directed work, but all roles should have a mix within a fiscal year. Office of the CEO members should monitor the mix of directed and leadership work that they are doing and provide as appropriate in Office of the CEO Meetings, so the CoS to the CEO and CEO are aware of the current balance and can make adjustments, if needed. Collaborating on Cross-Functional Initiatives While there are rare exceptions, members of the Office of the CEO are not forever owners of initiatives. They plug in to help achieve critical milestones or fill gaps. When a member of the Office of the CEO joins an initiative, there should be agreement from key stakeholders around: The level of support required The Office of the CEO members’ scope and responsibilities The exit criteria for the Office of the CEO If required, the long-term plan for ongoing initiative or project support Office of the CEO members can be reassigned based on the needs of the business and priorities of the CEO. In most cases, a member of the Office of the CEO will remain with a project until the exit criteria for the Office of the CEO is achieved. If a project extends beyond its anticipated timeframe or priorities change, a member may have to leave a project before the agreed upon exit criteria is achieved. When a member of the Office of the CEO exits an ongoing initiative they will: Provide as much notice as possible that the Office of the CEO will no longer support the initiative Document their key responsibilities Support a project DRI in identifying new owners When possible, stay engaged in the initiative in a limited capacity during an agreed upon transition period There may be instances in which the Office of the CEO leaving leads to a project scope being reduced or deprioritized. In these instances, the Office of the CEO member will be responsible for engaging key stakeholders around the keep/expand scope or go/no-go decision. It will be clearly documented and key folks will be involved in the decision and aware of the outcome. E-Group Offsite The executives get together every quarter for the e-group offsite. The CoS to the CEO plays an important role. It’s 3 to 4 days long with a Functional Leaders Meeting within the following days. There are recurring discussion topics as well as a discussion on content chosen by the CEO. In addition, the CoS to the CEO is responsible for preparing the CEO for offsites by: Finalizing the agenda to include CEO input Working with the CEO on what to cover in offsite introductions and",

    "content": "initiative they will: Provide as much notice as possible that the Office of the CEO will no longer support the initiative Document their key responsibilities Support a project DRI in identifying new owners When possible, stay engaged in the initiative in a limited capacity during an agreed upon transition period There may be instances in which the Office of the CEO leaving leads to a project scope being reduced or deprioritized. In these instances, the Office of the CEO member will be responsible for engaging key stakeholders around the keep/expand scope or go/no-go decision. It will be clearly documented and key folks will be involved in the decision and aware of the outcome. E-Group Offsite The executives get together every quarter for the e-group offsite. The CoS to the CEO plays an important role. It’s 3 to 4 days long with a Functional Leaders Meeting within the following days. There are recurring discussion topics as well as a discussion on content chosen by the CEO. In addition, the CoS to the CEO is responsible for preparing the CEO for offsites by: Finalizing the agenda to include CEO input Working with the CEO on what to cover in offsite introductions and closings Helping the CEO to prepare for sessions that the CEO will facilitate Managing the Functional Leaders Functional Leaders is a group comprised of all CEO-Skips, select People Business Partners, and a few other folks as nominated by members of E-Group. The CoS to the CEO enables and manages this group. Program managing JiHu A member of the Office of the CEO is the DRI within GitLab for the success of GitLab’s partnership with JiHu. Coordination with JiHu requires engagement from multiple functions within GitLab. The Office of the CEO ensures that the appropriate folks are engaged at the right times and that GitLab provides appropriate support to this separate entity. For example, this member ensures that there is an aligned process among relevant GitLab functions after a customer requests to transit to JiHu: After the Customer’s request of novation from GitLab to JiHu is approved, the member of the Office of the CEO opens a new issue as soon as the contract is issued, and assigns the issue to GitLab Accounting department. This issue triggers the Accounting development to update SFDC, Zuora and NS. If there is no issue raised in the month, it means there is no novation in that month. This process takes effects from 2023-02-01, and replaces the previous process that an issue is created each month regardless whether there is novation in the month or not. Organizational pulse Due to its cross-functional scope and access to information, the Office of the CEO is uniquely positioned to see what is happening across the company. Members of the Office of the CEO are encouraged to regularly have coffee chats with folks outside of the team and share key insights and feedback from these conversations. Measuring results We are evaluating different ways to measure our success as a team. These include: A company-wide team satisfaction score A pulse survey sent to a few targeted folks who have worked closely with the Office of the CEO team members in the past quarter Score against team quarterly goals Score on success in a few top initiatives within a quarter Chief of Staff Shadow The Chief of Staff to the CEO may occasionally have a Chief of Staff Shadow, a GitLab team member who will participate in a specific project or initiative for a fixed time. Depending on the project or initiative, the team member may spend most of their time with an Office of the CEO team member instead. Shadow responsibilities could include: taking notes, providing feedback, and/or supporting the overall initiative success. This role would be in addition to any existing responsibilities at GitLab. Participants would opt in to experience another function within GitLab and contribute to a different part of the business. Since participation would be in addition to an existing workload, managers must sign off before a CoS to the CEO Shadow can participate. Interested team members can share their interest with the Chief of Staff to the CEO in the #ceo-chief-of-staff-team Slack channel. The CoS to the CEO will follow up with you to understand what you are looking to get out of the experience and review projects that may be a good match. If there is not an existing project, you will be kept in mind for future opportunities. Once a project or initiative to Shadow has been identified and the team member decides to participate, the team member should open a merge request to add their name to the below table. The MR should be shared through Slack in the #ceo-chief-of-staff-team channel for review and merge. Optionally, the team member can make use of the internship for learning as a framework to guide the Shadow period.

    "title": "Handbook Escalation | The GitLab Handbook",
    "content": "Handbook Escalation For information on team members’ roles and responsibilities, see Content Websites page. Introduction The Handbook is a critical part of empowering team members to do their jobs effectively. As such, we have a group of team members who assist in resolving issues affecting all team members. Reporting an issue If you’re looking for general help, please see the editing handbook page. Any work stopping issues should be reported in the #handbook-escalation channel in Slack. Otherwise, consider creating an issue in the relevant content sites repository and posting in the #handbook Slack channel. When to escalate an issue Issues should only be escalated if it relates to: Default branch being broken Broken infrastructure Time sensitive updates to the handbook where there is an issue in making the update “Keep main green” group If after posting in #handbook-escalation, you are not receiving a response, please ping the handbook DRIs if it’s within their working hours. If they are not available, the “keep main green” group have volunteered to assist when available. Please take into consideration a team member’s timezone, working hours according to their Slack profile, and their Slack status on whether they’re out of office. Additionally, any GitLab team member can volunteer to join the #handbook-escalation channel and help out. If you would like to join the group, please ask anyone in the group to add you. Similarly, team members can leave the group at any time by leaving the GitLab group. Expectations for the group Make sure you are in and do not mute the #handbook-escalation channel. When an issue is reported: Acknowledge the team member and let them know you are looking into it. You can check on #production, #incidents-dotcom, and #is-this-known to see if it’s a known issue with infrastructure or other problems. Provide an update as soon as you are able to confirm their problem. You can also post updates in #mr-buddies and/or #handbook as appropriate. Offer to have a Zoom call to help replicate or resolve the issue if it is not straight forward. Resolve the problem, or provide feedback to the team member on how they can resolve it. If you do not believe you can resolve it and need further assistance, consider any or all of the following: Ping another member of the Keep main green group. Ping the handbook DRI, or a member of the code maintainer group. Create a bug issue with details. When to hand over to Reliability Engineering Handbook escalation deals specifically with matters relating to the content-sites projects. If a reported issue relates to the GitLab product or the infrastructure running the handbook, then it should be escalated to the Reliability Engineering team. To report an incident follow the instructions on the Incident Management page: https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/incident-management/#reporting-an-incident Common Incidents and Tips Failing pipeline Please see the handbook editing page for guidance and examples. Managing broken main alerts in #handbook-escalation All broken CI pipelines for the main branch of the handbook repository are automatically posted in the Slack channel. These reports should be investigated and addressed where needed. Once a report has been looked at, please leave a comment stating the nature of the problem, action taken, and add a ✅ reaction to the message to show that it has been handled. If for some reason there is a large amount of failures resulting in spamming the channel, the error reporting can be turned off in the repository settings: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/content-sites/handbook/-/settings/integrations Stuck Merge Train To see the status of the merge train (useful when team members are reporting that their MRs seem ‘stuck’ on the train), see this issue to check the status and perform a workaround, if necessary. TL;DR for workaround: If the first/oldest MR iid in the FIFO list (sort=asc by ID) is actively running a pipeline and eventually gets merged, then things are moving along, just slowly. If the first one in the list isn’t currently running any pipeline, remove it from the train and re-add it (it should go to the end). Runbook for about.gitlab.com While the handbook is no longer on about.gitlab.com, some of the information in the runbook for about.gitlab.com incident handling may be helpful.

    "content": "Field Marketing The role of Field Marketing at GitLab is to work closely with sales to support marketing messages & pipeline building at a regional level through in-person and virtual interactions. Field Marketing Mission The mission of Field Marketing at GitLab is to strategically support the Large, Mid-Market & Public Sector go-to-market teams at a regional level through in-person and virtual interactions (quality vs. quantity) as well as serving as the voice of the regional go-to-market teams to the wider marketing team, and being the voice of marketing into the go-to-market teams we support, in order to create, accelerate, and expand the sales pipeline with our direct sellers and partner ecosystem. In alignment with the marketing mission of being New First Order focused, Field Marketing also supports the expand motion with customers. Field Marketing Vision We want to be the most innovative and pipeline centric team within the marketing organization that uses data to make informed decisions while also continuing to invest in ourselves to promote career growth and opportunities. Field Marketing Goals Sales Acceleration Engaging with existing customers New growth opportunities Demand Unique inquiries Influence of sales accepted opportunities Influence of sales pipeline Both direct and channel driven Market Intelligence Test out new messaging or positioning Countries of Focus In alignment with the FY25 Marketing strategy, Field Marketing focuses on specific countries. Details can be found here in our internal handbook. Cities of Focus Tier 1 Cities A Field Marketer should have no more than 5 cities - cities with the largest LAM - that you want to build a ground swell in and be physically present at least 2 per quarter. Tier 2 Cities A Field Marketer should have no more than 3 Tier 2 cities - cities you want to be physically present in at least 1/quarter. FMMs should work with Large & MM sales teams to determine these cities. Types of Programs Field Marketing Runs GitLab Owned Field Events GitLab Connect GitLab Connect is a full or half day event with both customers and prospects in attendance sharing stories & lessons learned about GitLab. SAE’s will be responsible for asking customers to speak and Marketing, through a combination of SDR outreach, database and ad geotargeting will drive attendance to the event. If you would like to propose a GitLab Connect in your city, please follow these instructions for requesting an event. Interested in seeing a GitLab Connect in action? Check it out. Field Marketing Owned Virtual Events For information regarding process, epic codes, templates and more, please visit our Field Marketing Owned Virtual Events page. Executive Roundtables Executive Roundtables can be run virtually or in-person, and be organized through a 3rd party vendor or GitLab. These events differ from webcasts/events mainly due to the size of the audience and the interactivity level. A roundtable is run as an open discussion between the host (usually 3rd party vendor), GitLab presenter and the audience. The host would open with an introduction of themselves and the topic for the session, then introduce the GitLab presenter and have them give an overview of GitLab followed by the host asking questions directly to specific people in the audience for them to openly answer and discuss. The advantage of a roundtable is that you can document the meeting more closely and understand more about an organization’s pains and problems. Below are best practices when running a roundtable: Content creation - FMM to work with Sales Managers to decide on most relevant or hot topics in the region Speaker request - Put through a Product and Solution Marketing Support Request and fill out the template Example of scripts for host and GitLab presenter Example of meeting notes to document conversations during the session Ensure questions are prepared between host and GitLab presenter beforehand to lead the conversations within the session Assign notes of each delegate to list leads for upload onto SFDC Pre-analysis of delegates - check to see if their organization is currently a user of GitLab, whether they’re CE or EE customers. This could be a great way to start or dig into deeper conversations with the delegate. Ensure you have familiarised yourself with the White Glove Event Follow Up process for this type of event. 3rd Party Events We will sponsor regional 3rd party events in an effort to build the GitLab brand and also to gather leads. Different types of 3rd party events include, but are not limited to: Agile Events City run technology meetings Customer/prospect run DevOps events on invite Executive relationship building events via companies like Apex Assembly & Argyle Executive Forum Executive Meetings SLA for Executive Meetings The SLA for executive meetings is at least 120 in advance of the conference start date. This allows time to confirm executive support, set up the scheduling process, and give Sales enough time to schedule meetings before the event. Executive meetings at conferences run by Corporate Events This occurs when the Corporate Events team sponsors a large conference and requests that Regional Marketing manage scheduling the executive meetings during the event (in a separate meeting room). The Marketing Operations team will set up the main conference Marketo program and SFDC campaign for the Corporate Events team. The FMC will set up the executive meetings Marketo program and SFDC campaign. The FMC will then nest the Marketo program in the folder that was created by Marketing Ops, and add the SFDC campaign as a child campaign to the parent campaign created by Marketing Ops. Executive meetings do not have their own campaign type and they are categorized as a conference, so the FMC will make sure the conference campaign type is indicated in Allocadia and the FMM will utilize the conference progression statuses for the lead list. The overall conference is owned by the Corporate Events team, but Regional Marketing owns the executive meetings.

The FMC will set up the executive meetings Marketo program and SFDC campaign. The FMC will then nest the Marketo program in the folder that was created by Marketing Ops, and add the SFDC campaign as a child campaign to the parent campaign created by Marketing Ops. Executive meetings do not have their own campaign type and they are categorized as a conference, so the FMC will make sure the conference campaign type is indicated in Allocadia and the FMM will utilize the conference progression statuses for the lead list. The overall conference is owned by the Corporate Events team, but Regional Marketing owns the executive meetings. Executive meetings at conferences run by Regional Marketing This occurs when the Regional Marketing team sponsors a large conference and obtains a separate meeting room to run executive meetings. The Regional Marketing FMC will set up the Marketo program and SFDC campaign for both the conference and the executive meetings. Executive meetings does not have its own campaign type and is categorized as a conference, so the conference progression statuses should be utilized. Both the conference and executive meetings will be owned by Regional Marketing. JiffleNow The Regional Marketing team utilizes a meeting scheduling tool called JiffleNow. The parameters that must be met to utilize this tool for executive meeting scheduling are listed here. Other Tactics Being the marketing experts for the region, GitLab Field Marketers are also responsible for using other tactics to help generate leads to build pipeline. We have options such as survey tools, both of current employees and past employees based on the 3rd party vendor we use, webcasts, direct mailings, and also various digital tactics. Digital Tactics To run plays where we are targeting a specific geography or where we would like to propose content syndication, we work through our Digital Marketing Programs team. Please create an issue utilizing DMPs Paid Digital Request Issue Template if you’d like them to do work for you. To run plays where we are targeting a specific list of accounts, we utilize 6sense. Tracking success of digital tactics Please ensure you are using our UTM tracker (look up Google Analytics Campaign Tagging Tool - UTM generator for tracking in the Gdrive to find doc). In order to identify which campaigns are from the Field Marketing team, you must add the letters fmm at the end of your campaign name in column E. All lowercase with no spaces or special characters. This allows us to pull ROI reporting, so please don’t leave these letters out or else you will lose reporting from a dashboard standpoint. Confidentiality in GitLab Issues and Epics When working in GitLab issues and epics, please remember that due to GitLab’s value of Transparency, many of our issues and epics are, by default, public. Best practice is to avoid including any PII or login details in issues and epics directly. If posting details of this nature is a necessity, please remember to always make your issue or epic Confidential when doing so. Please also be diligent in your issues and epics regarding comments made by other team members as well. If you notice another team member has posted details that should not remain public, immediately make the issue or epic Confidential. Other options to allow our issues to remain public, are including PII in a spreadsheet or document posted in the issue or epic that are only accessible by certain people. If logins need to be shared, please utilize the Marketing Vault in 1Password. For more information regarding confidentiality levels and compliancy, please visit this handbook page.

FMMs and managers to keep details in this spreadsheet regarding both positive and negative experiences with various event vendors for team reference.

    "content": "event asset copy, as well as general spelling and grammar checks Use Claude to analyze meeting and offsite notes (such as the request for Claude to analyze territory review notes here) Utilize Claude for account research, such as the example the SA team created here Use Claude to pull specific information for executive roundtables to provide a structured summary based on company information and attendees (see below examples) Company Overview Persona Role Opinion on roundtable topic sourced from relevant articles on the web How GitLab aligns with companies’ DevOps and AI strategies Give discussion points on data residency, AI regulations, and implementation Using Claude to help create short fun quiz questions to be used at events. A quiz can be a great way to increase engagement, enhance learning, foster interaction, and create memorable experiences that extend well beyond the event itself. An example here of the prompt and quiz questions here Field Marketing Campaign Issue Templates, Epic Codes and Progression Status Field Marketing utilizes the below issue templates and epic codes for virtual events and other campaign tactics. Conference (In-Person) Progression Status Conference (Virtual) Progression Status Conference (Hybrid) Progression Status Conference (Executive Meetings) Progression Status Content Syndication Progression Status Direct Mail Progression Status Executive Roundtable (In-Person, Virtual or Hybrid) Progression Status Owned Event (In-Person, Virtual or Hybrid) Progression Status Sponsored Webcast Progression Status Survey Progression Status Vendor Arranged Meetings (In-Person, Virtual or Hybrid) Progression Status Webcast Progression Status Workshop (In-Person, Virtual or Hybrid) Progression Status Event Lead Collection Should-Knows Not every field event or lead are the same. There will be times when meeting/scanning leads and notetaking for the interaction will require a tweaked processing procedure. A few examples are below: High Priority leads: There are situations where GitLab leadership wants extra attention placed toward a prospective lead/account, assuming the right criteria is met for that lead/account. These leads are referred to as High Priority and utilize the high priority process. This label not only means its namesake, but it also means the lead will circumvent our normal lead routing and MQL processes to be sent immediately to SDR/BDR for strategic outreach. There are a few reasons why a lead would be marked as High Priority, but for this particular handbook page there are two primary definitions to focus on: High Priority Campaign: This lead was acquired during a high priority event. While strategizing for the quarter and year, Sales and Marketing leadership discuss what upcoming field events will be important based on GitLab’s current and future goals. If a field event is determined to fit the criteria, all leads collected from this event will be marked as high priority and quickly routed for follow up. Leadership will communicate what campaigns qualify White Glove: A white glove lead needs strategic outreach and will involve the SDR, Account Executive and maybe more. Generally, these leads were highly engaged in conversation about GitLab, have detailed event notes about the engagement and or were engaged with specific GitLab team members during the event. White glove leads can exist within a high priority campaign, so use best judgement on which label is most appropriate between the two Recording high priority status for either of these types is simple and included in the spreadsheet used for self-service list uploads under the High Priority Reasons? column - as a dropdown option. The reason feeds into Marketo’s High Priority Reason temp field, which then processes the lead for early lead routing. Post event lead flow for each campaign After Field Marketing has executed a campaign, the Field Marketing Manager is responsible for ensuring that the campaign has been fully operational to include the following: he campaign DRI reviews and cleans up the list following the guidelines forlist imports SDRs should not be asked to follow up leads before they are added to Salesforce If a follow-up email was to go out to all attendees and no-shows, the FMM is responsible for ensuring that emails were sent. Did the campaign respondents receive the correct amount of MQL points they should have received the activity they participated in? Person scores are available for viewing in our Custom Links section of each SFDC campaign. This allows you to view the MQL score of the campaign members, whether they be a lead or contact, all within one view. Did a lead/contact hit our MQL threshold and have the SDRs followed up with this record and moved them beyond the MQL stage? Update all the relevant tabs in the field marketing campaign event planning sheet. Adding SFDC Campaigns to Leads for Attribution For instructions on how to add a SFDC campaign to a lead for attribution, please watch this two minute instructional video (you must be signed into GitLab Unfiltered to view). Field Marketers within SFDC To help with reporting within SFDC, each Field Marketing Manager is assigned the accounts based on SAE/AE assignment. Field Marketing has decided to align with the SAE/AE vs. 100% geo focused in an effort to foster collaboration. Routing for geo reps is done through zip codes worldwide. Named accounts and the US Public Sector are manually handled differently. Sales Ops will run monthly audits to update PubSec and Named accounts. Field Marketing Management works with Sales Ops to keep this information up to date. Should you come across an account you believe should be owned (or perhaps NOT owned by you) please follow these steps: Within the account in SFDC, please chatter @sales-support and provide reason why this account should be updated If more than 10 accounts need updated or if a FMM changes regions, then please open a sales ops issue requesting the update be made. Complete details on how GitLab Sales handles rules of Account Engagement can be found here. PathFactory Via our Marketing Operations team, Field Marketers can request Author Role access to PathFactory to upload and curate assets into tracks that are then disseminated for use in Marketo, about.gitlab.com, and other campaign-related channels.

    "content": "each Field Marketing Manager is assigned the accounts based on SAE/AE assignment. Field Marketing has decided to align with the SAE/AE vs. 100% geo focused in an effort to foster collaboration. Routing for geo reps is done through zip codes worldwide. Named accounts and the US Public Sector are manually handled differently. Sales Ops will run monthly audits to update PubSec and Named accounts. Field Marketing Management works with Sales Ops to keep this information up to date. Should you come across an account you believe should be owned (or perhaps NOT owned by you) please follow these steps: Within the account in SFDC, please chatter @sales-support and provide reason why this account should be updated If more than 10 accounts need updated or if a FMM changes regions, then please open a sales ops issue requesting the update be made. Complete details on how GitLab Sales handles rules of Account Engagement can be found here. PathFactory Via our Marketing Operations team, Field Marketers can request Author Role access to PathFactory to upload and curate assets into tracks that are then disseminated for use in Marketo, about.gitlab.com, and other campaign-related channels. Field Marketing currently has Reporter level access. To view the difference in user roles, head over to the PathFactory page. The Benefits of having Author Role Access Efficiency gains: It takes more time to create a request issue for the Campaigns Team and wait for the request to be processed than it takes to upload an asset or create the track yourself. Ownership: Having author role access to PathFactory will allow Field Marketing to have control on asset uploads and content tracks to ultimately personalise the PathFactory experience according to region, country and target accounts. Optimisation: Viewing each asset/track’s performance can help Field Marketing refine and optimize the content with monthly or quarterly refreshes. Getting Started Visit the user role section of the PathFactory page to learn more about the author role. Required Training Please review the Pathfactory Training videos (specifically the author role training) before submitting an AR to request author role access. This section will continue to be fleshed out as we rollout to the global Field Marketing team. Asana The global Field Marketing team is working with the Marketing Operations team to implement Asana as our new project management tool. Asana Handbook Page Asana Asana Marketing Calendar Please visit the internal handbook page here for links to our Asana Marketing Calendar that highlights upcoming events and details. Asana tips and best practices If you do not need a task, please delete all subtasks and then the task itself. This will remove the task from the view of everyone involved and is less confusing. Changing the task status can be overwritten by the rules we have set in place, so it’s better to delete if you aren’t using it. Examples of tasks that should be deleted if you are not using them: Build Landing Page, Email tasks, Build Target List. Do not make any changes to or delete the “Host Live Event” task (or the task that just has the name of the event on it). This is used for the SSOT Marketing Calendar. It will auto-populate, no action required on your part. When you complete a task that is assigned to you, please be sure to click “Mark Complete”. You can find the “Mark Complete” button at the top of the task. We have several rules to automate the task status field, but they depend on tasks being marked complete when they are done to move to the next step of the workflow. You have subtasks on emails called “Email approved by DRI” and on landing pages called “Landing page approved by DRI”. If you approve the sample/page, please be sure to click “Approve” on these tasks. This will record your approval and trigger the next step in the workflow (push live, schedule to send, etc). If you copy new Email tasks from the template, please be sure to change the subtasks from “(template)” to the email number (as well as the main task). This will help avoid confusion in notifications and on My Tasks. We have added boards for MOps and Lifecycle to track their tasks. Relevant subtasks for these teams will be automatically added to the respective projects upon project creation. If you create a new task (or subtask, in the case of emails, landing pages, etc) after the project is created, please be sure to add the MOps subtasks to: OP - Marketing Operations Support and the Lifecycle subtasks to: Lifecycle Marketing - Email Approvals. Process for moving events from Plan to WIP The following is the process for when a Field Marketing event moves from the draft/plan phase to becoming finalized and actively managed in Asana (WIP). SLAs Please plan your timelines accordingly based on the below SLAs. Keep in mind these SLAs must also include additional time for any Friends & Family Days or holidays. Contract Requests: 3 business days for the FMC to enter into ZIP Plan to WIP - 3 business days for the FMC to complete, once the FMM completes the FMC Checklist and Ecosystem Involvement tasks in the Asana project Marketing Operations Requests - 5 business days Moving from Plan to WIP Please note that this is an interim process while the Regional Marketing team begins utilizing Asana. Automations are still being implemented, so there will be many iterations to the below instructions as all global teams move to Asana. Step-by-Step FMM pings the FMC in the main Field Marketing issue and requests the FMC create the Asana project NOTE: The FMM will not fill out any additional information in the GitLab issue. All work will be managed in the Asana project. FMC reviews the Allocadia sub-category and line item panel details, as well as checks that the forecasted cost is in the correct month (according to the prepaid policy) for the tactic and makes any changes necessary FMC to make sure the correct FMM and FMC",

Contract Requests: 3 business days for the FMC to enter into ZIP Plan to WIP - 3 business days for the FMC to complete, once the FMM completes the FMC Checklist and Ecosystem Involvement tasks in the Asana project Marketing Operations Requests - 5 business days Moving from Plan to WIP Please note that this is an interim process while the Regional Marketing team begins utilizing Asana. Automations are still being implemented, so there will be many iterations to the below instructions as all global teams move to Asana. Step-by-Step FMM pings the FMC in the main Field Marketing issue and requests the FMC create the Asana project NOTE: The FMM will not fill out any additional information in the GitLab issue. All work will be managed in the Asana project. FMC reviews the Allocadia sub-category and line item panel details, as well as checks that the forecasted cost is in the correct month (according to the prepaid policy) for the tactic and makes any changes necessary FMC to make sure the correct FMM and FMC are listed in the Allocadia panel for the event. The team members listed in Allocadia will sync to the GitLab issue and then to the Asana project (Asana tasks will be assigned based on these roles as well). FMC creates a new project in Asana by following the below steps: FMC adds the Asana-Sync-Project label to the GitLab issue. Adding this label will trigger the Asana project to be created utilizing the GitLab > Asana sync. In Asana, please give the system a couple of minutes to pull all of the details through. You receive a notification when the Asana project has been created. The BT Bot will also comment in the GitLab issue that the Asana project has been created and will provide the project link. When the Asana project is created, the project will also be automatically added to the FY26 Asana Marketing Calendar. FMC to fill in any Event Details that did not sync from the GitLab issue FMC reviews the list of tasks and adjusts any past due tasks accordingly. If new dates are not available yet, please remove both the due date and task owner until they are available to add back in. If this step is not taken, other team members will receive notifications about tasks being past due, which will lead to confusion. Please keep your projects as updated and current as possible! FMC then pings the FMM in the GitLab issue that the event has been moved to Asana and is ready for the FMM to work through their tasks in Asana Important Notes for FMMs The FMM must fill in and complete the FMC Checklist task before the FMC will be notified to move the project to WIP. Please always hit the complete button for each task, once the task is finished. We have many dependencies built into our Asana template and if you do not complete a task, the next steps will not be triggered for other team members. Please add any appropriate sub-region or country tags to your project. NOTE: The main region categories (AMER, APAC, EMEA, PubSec) will be automatically associated. Many tags are already created in Asana, please utilize these tags and do not edit any existing tags. If you need a new tag created, please request your tag in this Tag Request Form. Closing out Asana Projects Once the event is over, the FMM will confirm the lead list has been processed and any remaining tasks for the event have been completed. NOTE: You must complete or delete all open tasks in a project or they will still show up in your assigned tasks (see how to bulk complete tasks here). The FMM will then go to the top of the page and click Set status and select Complete. Rescheduling or Canceling Events Rescheduling or Canceling a Webcast or Virtual Workshop Please note that the process for rescheduling or canceling a webcast or virtual workshop involves additional steps. For details regarding these instructions, please see below. Please see process here for rescheduling and here for canceling. For all other event types (including in-person workshops), please see instructions below. Rescheduling Events FMM Tasks FMM to ping the FMC and staff/DRIs in the main Field Marketing issue to communicate the updated date(s). FMM to obtain an addendum/updated contract from the venue with the new date(s) (if applicable). The FMM will then re-open the original contract request and ping the FMC with new date(s) and addendum/updated contract. FMM to update the date with any additional vendors (such as Boundless, PizzaTime, etc.). If utilizing their personal Zoom for the event, FMM to make the date change in the Zoom account where the event was set up. Make sure to check the Notify registrants about changes to this meeting checkbox so registrants gets the date change email notification with their unique join link from Zoom. If there are registrations for the event, please either notify the registrants of the date change directly, or ask your FMC to create a date change email issue and provide copy in the copy doc. Note that this email must follow the MOps SLA. FMC Tasks FMC to update the new date(s) in the Allocadia sub-category and adjust the forecasted amount (if over the prepaid $5k threshold and if the new date falls in a new month). The FMC will update the date(s) in the appropriate Google calendar for the event invite. The FMC will update the epic details and sub-issue due dates (and issue titles), as well as make the necessary changes to any upcoming asset send dates. If there are any emails scheduled to send, the FMC will ping MOps specially in those issues to have them unschedule the sends first.

Make sure to check the Notify registrants about changes to this meeting checkbox so registrants gets the date change email notification with their unique join link from Zoom. If there are registrations for the event, please either notify the registrants of the date change directly, or ask your FMC to create a date change email issue and provide copy in the copy doc. Note that this email must follow the MOps SLA. FMC Tasks FMC to update the new date(s) in the Allocadia sub-category and adjust the forecasted amount (if over the prepaid $5k threshold and if the new date falls in a new month). The FMC will update the date(s) in the appropriate Google calendar for the event invite. The FMC will update the epic details and sub-issue due dates (and issue titles), as well as make the necessary changes to any upcoming asset send dates. If there are any emails scheduled to send, the FMC will ping MOps specially in those issues to have them unschedule the sends first. The FMC will re-open the Marketo LP issue and request the date be changed in the LP. This will most likely change the LP URL as well, in which case, the FMC will update the LP link in the epic and notify the FMM of the changed link (to communicate to the sales team). The FMC will follow these instructions to update the date of the event on the Events Page (if applicable). Allocadia: FMC to change the ISO date in the SFDC campaign name to the new start date. SFDC: FMC to change the ISO date in the SFDC campaign name to the new date and update the start and end date fields. Marketo: FMC to change the ISO date in the Marketo program to the new date and update the event date and UTM tokens. Also update asset expiration. If the FMM has submitted an addendum/updated contract, FMC to submit a PO change request via Zip. Canceling Events FMM Tasks FMM to ping the FMC and staff/DRIs in the main Field Marketing issue to communicate the cancellation and close out the issue. FMM to update the cancellation status with any additional vendors (such as Boundless, PizzaTime, etc.). If utilizing their personal Zoom for the event, FMM to delete the event from the Zoom account where the event was set up. Make sure to check the Send meeting cancellation email to registrants checkbox so registrants gets the cancellation email notification from Zoom. You will also be able to edit the cancellation message in the body of the email. If there are registrations for the event, please either notify the registrants of the cancellation directly, or ask your FMC to create a cancellation email issue and provide copy in the copy doc. Note that this email must follow the MOps SLA. FMC Tasks FMC to update Allocadia showing the event as canceled by going to the event sub-category panel and selecting Yes to the Campaign Canceled? dropdown. FMC to also add in CANCELED to the event sub-category title and to the Official Event/Campaign Name field so the title in the main issue stays updated. FMC to remove any planned/forecasted costs in Allocadia accordingly. The FMC will delete the Google calendar invite in the appropriate calendar. The FMC will follow these instructions to delete the event from the Events Page (if applicable) The FMC will comment regarding the cancellation in all open sub-issues and close out the issues. If there are any emails scheduled to send, the FMC will ping MOps specifically in those issues to have them unschedule the sends first. If applicable, FMC to ping procurement and finance in the Coupa req to notify them that the event has been canceled. If the FMM is not sending their own cancellation email to registrants and would like to send a Marketo cancellation email, create an issue for the request and triage to Marketing Ops. Please Note: This email must be scheduled and sent BEFORE the rest of the steps below can be completed. Once all sub-issues are closed, the FMC will also note the cancellation in the epic and close the epic. SFDC: Add [CANCELED] to the campaign name and select Aborted in the Campaign Status dropdown. Marketo: Add [CANCELED] to the program name. Go to the Salesforce campaign sync field and click on the linked campaign, select None from the dropdown and click Save. This removes the SFDC and Marketo sync for the program. Deactivate any activated smart campaigns. FMC to ping MOps with the Marketo program link in the #mktgops Slack channel and request the program be deleted (FM does not have access in Marketo to delete programs). Please Note: Once the Marketo program is deleted, the Marketo LP will also be deleted and not accessible by anyone with the registration link. Process to Close Marketo Landing Pages and Landing Page Forms Marketo Asset Expiration Please follow the instructions found on the campaigns and programs handbook page to set expirations on program assets during program set up. Options for Closing LPs and LP Forms There are two options for closing Marketo landing pages: Closing the LP registration form (which removes the registration form from the LP so registrations can no longer be accepted) and updating the LP to explain why the registration form is no longer available (either the event has reached capacity or the event has occurred). Closing the entire LP. If someone clicks on the LP link, it will take them to our about.gitlab.com page instead of a registration LP. This option is now done automatically during the Marketo Asset Expiration process. Asset expiration occurs 4 weeks after the event date, so it is important to close the registration form and update the LP verbiage once an event reaches capacity or has occurred so the LP does not remain open and active during this time.

    "content": "the Marketo program is deleted, the Marketo LP will also be deleted and not accessible by anyone with the registration link. Process to Close Marketo Landing Pages and Landing Page Forms Marketo Asset Expiration Please follow the instructions found on the campaigns and programs handbook page to set expirations on program assets during program set up. Options for Closing LPs and LP Forms There are two options for closing Marketo landing pages: Closing the LP registration form (which removes the registration form from the LP so registrations can no longer be accepted) and updating the LP to explain why the registration form is no longer available (either the event has reached capacity or the event has occurred). Closing the entire LP. If someone clicks on the LP link, it will take them to our about.gitlab.com page instead of a registration LP. This option is now done automatically during the Marketo Asset Expiration process. Asset expiration occurs 4 weeks after the event date, so it is important to close the registration form and update the LP verbiage once an event reaches capacity or has occurred so the LP does not remain open and active during this time. The FMC will track all open Marketo LPs and will be responsible for requesting the LP form be closed by Marketing Ops once the event occurs or if an event reaches capacity. To close the LP registration form, the FMC will re-open the Marketo LP issue and request Marketing Ops follow one of the below processes (depending on campaign type, as Marketo program templates vary across different tactics). In the LP issue, the FMC will request Marketing Ops remove the registration form and will provide Marketing Ops specific verbiage for the top of the LP page. Please see standard verbiage options below. If the event is a workshop that was listed on the demo/workshop page, the FMC will also request Marketing Ops remove the listing. The FMC will update the due date of the issue. If an event has reached capacity The FMC will follow the above instructions to close the LP registration form and update the verbiage to specify the event has reached capacity. If there are remaining invite issues open once registration is closed, the FMC will note this in the issue(s) and close them. If an invite is already scheduled to be sent, the FMC will ask Marketing Ops to unschedule the send before closing the issue. The FMC will update the due date of the issue. If a LinkedIn campaign was run, the FMC will request the ABM team close the LinkedIn registration form in their ABM issue. There is no need to remove the event listing from the Events Page if an event has reached capacity. Having a sold out event listed could create more excitement over the event and encourage future attendees to register for events sooner. Standard verbiage for closing a Marketo LP after the event has occurred The below verbiage can be utilized/sent to Marketing Ops when closing a Marketo LP form after an event has occurred. Thank you for your interest in this [insert event type]. This event has concluded and registration is now closed, but GitLab has a number of hands-on events and educational programs scheduled at any given time. Please visit our events page for more information on upcoming events and dates. Standard verbiage for closing a Marketo LP if an event is at capacity The below verbiage can be utilized/sent to Marketing Ops when closing a Marketo LP form if an event is at capacity. Thank you for your interest in this [insert event type]. The event has reached capacity and registration is now closed, but GitLab has a number of hands-on events and educational programs scheduled at any given time. Please visit our events page for more information on upcoming events and dates. Closing a Marketo LP Form These instructions explain how to close a Marketo LP form and how to update the LPs verbiage at the top of the page. The page and the information on it will still be visible to visitors, but there will no longer be a form to fill out for registration. Closing a Webcast Marketo LP Form See instructions here. Closing a Workshop Marketo LP Form See instructions here. Adding and Removing Workshop Postings on the Regional Workshop Demo Pages We market our workshops on both the GitLab events page and via the below EMEA regional workshop/demo page (the AMER and APAC demo pages have been deprecated). The GitLab events page listings require an MR to add new events (see instructions here) and events will automatically drop off the page once the event date passes. But the regional workshop/demo pages require manual adjustment. When an EMEA workshop LP is created by Marketing Ops, they will add to the EMEA workshop/demo page once the LP is approved. When the workshop is completed and the FMC requests that Marketing Ops closes the LP, Marketing Ops will also remove the listing from the regional workshop/demo page. EMEA Workshop/Demo Page Regional Workshop Demo Pages - Instructions for Marketing Ops Marketing Ops will add EMEA workshops only to the EMEA Tech Demos and Workshop page. For more information regarding the regional workshop/demo pages, please visit this handbook page. Closing a Marketo LP These instructions are standard across all campaign types and will close down the entire LP and re-routes visitors to our about.gitlab.com page. If you have set up asset expiration previously, this step will occur automatically. Sign into Marketo Click into the Marketo program for the landing page you wish to close Click into Assets Click Registration Landing Page At the top of the page click Landing Page Actions In the drop down list click Unapprove Click the orange Unapprove button in the pop up box Go to your landing page URL and make sure the landing page is no longer active (the site that should pop up is about.gitlab.com) Go to the 01a or 01b Registration Flow and",

    "content": "add to the EMEA workshop/demo page once the LP is approved. When the workshop is completed and the FMC requests that Marketing Ops closes the LP, Marketing Ops will also remove the listing from the regional workshop/demo page. EMEA Workshop/Demo Page Regional Workshop Demo Pages - Instructions for Marketing Ops Marketing Ops will add EMEA workshops only to the EMEA Tech Demos and Workshop page. For more information regarding the regional workshop/demo pages, please visit this handbook page. Closing a Marketo LP These instructions are standard across all campaign types and will close down the entire LP and re-routes visitors to our about.gitlab.com page. If you have set up asset expiration previously, this step will occur automatically. Sign into Marketo Click into the Marketo program for the landing page you wish to close Click into Assets Click Registration Landing Page At the top of the page click Landing Page Actions In the drop down list click Unapprove Click the orange Unapprove button in the pop up box Go to your landing page URL and make sure the landing page is no longer active (the site that should pop up is about.gitlab.com) Go to the 01a or 01b Registration Flow and deactivate the smart campaign Adding a Registrant after Marketo LP Reg Form is Closed If you have closed a Marketo LP registration form because your event has reached capacity but need to add in an important registrant after the fact, please follow the below instructions. IMPORTANT NOTE: Field Marketing does not have access for the below actions. Please ping Marketing Operations in the #mktgops Slack channel to add registrants when needed. Important context: The landing page and form themselves have no bearing on whether or not someone is synced. The sync relies solely on Program Members and their statuses. Thus, a person can fill out a form, but if their program member status is never updated to Registered, they will never sync over into the webcast in Zoom. Likewise, we can update someone’s status to Registered without any form every being filled out, and they will still sucessfully sync to Zoom. Navigate to the Database tab in Marketo In the quick find box, type in the person’s email and click the magnifying glass to search (If they do not exist, click NEW in the upper ribbon and add a new person. It will take up to 10 minutes for them to then show in the lead database) It will take you to a screen with everyone matching your query. Once you find the correct person, click them to highlight. Once highlighted, you can right click or select Person Actions from the upper ribbon Hover over Programs and click on Change Program Status... Search for the program you want to add them to (it should be the main program, not an invite send, etc) and select the status of Registered Check how many people this will affect. It should just be 1 (or the number you highlighted) Click RUN NOW to execute the action A status box will appear on the top right and tell you when the action finishes processing Once added as Registered scoring will trigger for the registrant Once the registrant is synced to zoom (within 30 min or so), the registrant will receive a confirmation email automatically from Zoom. You can use these steps to add anyone to a Marketo program. Registration Problems on a GitLab Landing Page If a registrant is having issues registering for an event on a GitLab landing page, please have them first try the below fixes. If these still do not work, open a bug issue with Marketing Ops to help determine if there is a problem with the landing page. Ask what browser they are utilizing and if there are any plugins potentially blocking the registration page. If they have not already, have them try registering utilizing Chrome. Have them try registering using Incognito Mode. Tactics that Involve Customer PII There are times that Field Marketing will run campaigns that involve building a landing page in Marketo in order to collect addresses for shipping swag. Examples of these instances are a 5k run, GitLab-hosted tasting event, direct mail campaigns, etc. When collecting addresses, please follow the below instructions for ensuring PII compliancy. Landing Page Verbiage When collecting addresses on our Marketo landing pages, make sure to always include the following verbiage on the page - By giving us your address, you are giving us permission to mail items to your home or office. We will not use this data for any other purposes. Pulling Addresses for Swag Sends Please note that due to PII compliancy, addresses collected in Marketo landing pages are not synced to SFDC. As a result, Marketing Ops support is required to pull the address list from Marketo (Field Marketing does not have this level of access in Marketo). Removing PII from Marketo Once the report is downloaded (or the event/tactic has ended and all swag has been sent), Marketing Ops will then also delete the PII information directly in Marketo. To request this support, please review this page and open an export request issue to specify when a list pull and PII deletion is needed. Also remember to delete PII from any order spreadsheets once swag has shipped. PII Compliancy Timeline Please remember to delete all customer PII within 90 days of an event (inlcuding lead list spreadsheets). Field Marketing Swag Brand Details for Swag and Event Assets For information regarding Brand support, please visit the Brand Design Handbook Page. Templates for requesting design/brand support are located here. You can also watch this video (must be logged into GitLab Unfiltered) regarding Brand templates and repos for previous and current brand designs.

To request this support, please review this page and open an export request issue to specify when a list pull and PII deletion is needed. Also remember to delete PII from any order spreadsheets once swag has shipped.

Store Portal Orders and Shipping Charges Please see the homepage of the Brilliant store portal for specific ordering instructions and helpful details.

All charges related to shipping will be associated to your specific campaign and these charges will process through our monthly invoice. When you place your orders through the store, you will be provided a shipping estimate during checkout.

Due to our prepaid policy, your shipping charges for the previous month will be reconciled in the following month, so please forecast accordingly. Example - You ship swag in August for an August event. Our August monthly invoice processes in September, so those August shipping charges should be forecasted in September.

General Lead Times: 6-8 weeks to produce a new item and 2-3 weeks to reorder current designs New swag ideas for bulk orders If you would like to source a new swag item for the team’s inventory, please reach out to @krogel directly. All new swag items must be approved by the Brand team for brand consistency. Field Marketing Event Assets Event assets utilized for shows (including backwalls, tablecloths, popup banners, event kits, etc.) are stocked at the Brilliant warehouse and can be ordered for events using the Brilliant store portal. It is also recommended that each Field Marketer keep a separate GitLab tablecloth, popup banner and table runner with them at home for easy access and to be utilized for events. Returning Field Marketing Event Assets and Swag It is the FMM’s responsibility to not only ship assets to events, but to also ensure the onsite event DRI ships the items back within 3 days of the end of the event. Every order placed through the Brilliant portal will include return labels (one return label per box) in a red envelope adhered to the inside flap of the box. The FMM is to make sure the onsite event DRI is aware of the location of the return shipping labels and of their responsibility to ship the items back. PLEASE NOTE: Trash and items not stored in the Brilliant warehouse should not be put in the return shipping boxes (this includes stickers, please see below for more sticker information). All event assets are to be folded neatly and packed up cleanly and securely in their original boxes. All tool kit items should be returned to the tool kits for future event use. Please do not send small numbers of swag back to the warehouse if the items were bundled, only send full bundles back to the warehouse for restock. Example: If pens come in bundles of ten, please do not send back 2 pens as these cannot be re-bundled. Feel free to keep small quantities of extra swag to give out to customers, if appropriate. Also, only open swag bundles as they are needed so items can be returned if not used. If you have any questions, please contact @krogel. Warehouse Address Brilliant Team, c/o Gitlab 1605 S Waukegan Rd Waukegan, IL 60085 415-980-4600 Stickers For sticker orders, please reach out to @krogel for details. If all stickers are not utilized at an event, please keep the stickers with you for future events. Print Collateral In order to stay environmentally-friendly, we generally do not provide large quantities of print collateral at events. However, if you do need printouts or gift bag stuffers for events, we utilize Vistaprint. Please log in using the Marketing 1pass. Another option in lieu of hundreds of printed handouts is to have a handful of printed and laminated pieces of collateral to utilize for visual reference while speaking with customers at an event. Additionally, you can create a QR Code to display at your event with that same piece of content for customers to download to their own devices. Ordering Items from the GitLab Swag Shop If you would like to order an item(s) from the GitLab Swag Shop for an event, Please reach out to Betsy Bula and let her know the item(s) you are interested in and the quantity and she will make sure she has enough in stock to spare. Then, please fill out this Google form for the total $ amount of the item(s) and the Brilliant team will grant you a store credit for the shop. You can use that store credit to pay for the items, and GitLab FP&A will “charge” your budget/Allocadia ID on the back end at the end of the month. Note: Order Code = Allocadia line item ID EMEA Field Marketing Swag The EMEA Field Marketing team utilises Brilliant to source, fulfill, ship and store (European and UK warehouses) swag branded swag items. We also utilise vendor Ten&One who can source swag items and who also currently store all EMEA event material. The FMC is responsible for ensuring adequate stock levels and coordinating field event swag logistics. Additional event assets utilized for shows (including backwalls, tablecloths, popup banners, etc.) are stocked at the Ten&One warehouse and can be shipped Budget Allocation: If there is an individual order dedicated to support one specific event (e.g Cloud Expo) an Allocadia line item should be created by the FMM in their regional activity plan under this specific event. If swag is required from the bulk order (e.g AWS, GCP, smaller events) the FMM should assign budget and move it to All EMEA per Quarter. If the event e.g Connect Day is handled by Ten & One as an all-in budget under the contract with Ten & One this should be included in that event sponsorship line item within the FMM’s regional plan. Please note shipping cost to be included in the SWAG cost that you budget per event. Invoicing: All invoices for Field Marketing are required to include the campaign’s Allocadia ID to allow for proper finance coding. Existing Items: Item descriptions and quantities are listed on the Reachdesk portal, please reach out to @helenadixon for current inventory levels. New Items and Designs: Requests for new swag items not already available require management approval. Any new swag designs must be approved by the brand team for brand consistency. You can suggest new designs in the swag slack channel or",

You will now be able to add the employee to any existing Groups so they can be assigned to a line of credit. Go back to the Employees page, locate this user, and click on the envelope icon near their name to send their Welcome Email. Manual Employee Edits How do I create another admin user? If the employee already has an account, click on the pencil next to their name, then the “edit” button and under the Permissions section, select “Admin User”. If the employee does not have an account, follow the instructions above. Removing Individual Employees Select the person icon at the top right of your screen and Business Account from the drop-down menu. Under Employees & Groups, select Employees. Click the pencil next to the employee you would like to remove. How do I change a user’s email address? Delete the user and re-add them to the account with the new email address. Make sure to re-add them to their group(s). What if a user has already registered their email with a personal Grubhub account? The credit will automatically show up on their account when it is active. They do not need to set up a new account. Creating Meal Credits Expand below to see details regarding Creating Meal Credits Creating Meal Credits Before you create a Meal Credit, make sure that you have created a Group to associate with that credit (details above). Note: Employees in the Grubhub portal refer to our registrants for an event. Hover over “Meal credit settings” and click “Meal credits”. Then, click “Add meal credit”. Name your meal credit; this is what your employees will see. We suggest including the name of the event or company associated with this meal credit so it’s easy for your employees to identify. Choose how long this budget is available. One-day budgets are best for single-day events (e.g. happy hours, meetings, celebrations). They can also repeat on specific days of the week. Weekly budgets are best for ongoing meal programs (e.g. providing employees lunch for the week). They can also repeat on a weekly basis. Then, select the time window for when the order must be placed and delivered, or simply check the “All day” box. Orders can be placed in advance but must be delivered within the designated timeframe. Next, choose what geographic areas your employees can order from. To ensure they can order from their home, select “Anywhere”. Under “Order Settings”, you can choose how your employees order their meals. Checking all options provides the most flexibility. Next, choose to require any sort of expense code/comments at checkout. Lastly, we recommend notifying your employees when their meal credit becomes available. We’ll send a customized, one-time email the morning their meal credit begins – so long as you create and assign meal credits the night before. Diners added to an existing budget will receive an email the morning after they’re added. Now, click “Add Meal Credit” and you can start adding groups to your new meal credit. Scroll down to select the group(s) you want associated with this meal credit and enter the budget amount. Click “Save” and you’re done! Meal Credits FAQ Expand below to see details regarding Meal Credits How do I create meal credits? Please see the above section, Creating Meal Credits, for a step-by-step guide. Can I change a meal credit after it starts? Yes. However, the date, frequency, and order window cannot be changed. My employee is not seeing their meal credit balance and/or is being asked to enter their personal credit card upon checkout. There could be a few reasons. Check to make sure all the below items are addressed. If you’re still facing this issue, please reach out to Grubhub Corporate Support. The account your employee is ordering from is not tied to a corporate account.

Pizzatime When to use Pizzatime Pizzatime will be utilized for larger, virtual-owned events that will host mid to executive-level registrants. Cost per person to be between $20-$40. It is important to note that Pizzatime will be utilized for pre-event meal credit distribution. Order Link Sharing It is important to note that there is no limit on link sharing when utilizing the Pizzatime platform. Meaning, once registrants receive the link to place their order, they can share it with non-registrants who can then redeem it for a meal. Limiting Meal Redemptions If attempting to limit the number of meal redemptions for an event, the below steps are recommended: Enable a Waitlist for the Marketo Landing Page and establish a redemption limit. Include the Pizzatime order link in your Confirmation Email copy. Individually register registrants until the established redemption limit is reached. Note: When a registrant is moved from Waitlisted to Registered, they will receive the Confirmation Email. Once the established redemption limit is reached, re-open the Marketo LP issue and request Marketing Ops remove the Pizzatime order link from the Confirmation Email copy. Details Regarding Pizzatime Financials and Budgeting It is important to note that in order to place an order with Pizzatime, you will be required to request a Coupa Virtual Card for payment. Please submit a Contract Request for the Coupa Virtual Card to your FMC with all the required details pertaining to your event. Note: Ensure all cost estimates have been added to Allocadia.",

    "content": "is important to note that there is no limit on link sharing when utilizing the Pizzatime platform. Meaning, once registrants receive the link to place their order, they can share it with non-registrants who can then redeem it for a meal. Limiting Meal Redemptions If attempting to limit the number of meal redemptions for an event, the below steps are recommended: Enable a Waitlist for the Marketo Landing Page and establish a redemption limit. Include the Pizzatime order link in your Confirmation Email copy. Individually register registrants until the established redemption limit is reached. Note: When a registrant is moved from Waitlisted to Registered, they will receive the Confirmation Email. Once the established redemption limit is reached, re-open the Marketo LP issue and request Marketing Ops remove the Pizzatime order link from the Confirmation Email copy. Details Regarding Pizzatime Financials and Budgeting It is important to note that in order to place an order with Pizzatime, you will be required to request a Coupa Virtual Card for payment. Please submit a Contract Request for the Coupa Virtual Card to your FMC with all the required details pertaining to your event. Note: Ensure all cost estimates have been added to Allocadia. If the final Pizzatime order cost is 10% above the requested Coupa Virtual Card amount, please inform your FMC as they will need to submit a PO Change Request. Note: The order confirmation page on Pizzatime will serve as your SOW. The steps below detail how to get to the confirmation page. To confirm which month the spend will hit, please refer to our Prepaid Policy.

Once you place your Pizzatime order, Pizzatime will provide a unique ordering link for your event. You will then share this link with your registrants in the registration confirmation email and/or the reminder email (please remember to add it to your copy doc), to allow them to place their orders. Steps to Placing Your Pizztime Order Proceed to book your Pizzatime order. Follow all of the prompts, selecting food & drink options relative to your event. Once you reach the confirmation/payment page, take a screenshot of the entire page. Attach this screenshot to your contract request (this serves as your SOW). Submit a Contract Request to your FMC. They will provide you with your Coupa virtual card information, once the order has been approved and the card has been issued.

Suggesting an Event or Tactic If you are interested in requesting Field Marketing’s support for a particular in-person or virtual event or tactic, please follow the process listed on our Events Page. Field Marketing planning It is our goal to have planning for each qtr completed four (4) weeks before the next quarter starts. At this time, we have the following time line set for regional plans: Q1 plan is due Jan 13 Q2 plan is due April 3 Q3 plan is due July 3 Q4 plan is due Oct 2 A standard deck will also be used to ensure consistency across the world in terms of how the plan is presented. The SSOT of the plan remains in GitLab on our various issue boards. FY25 Standard deck. Note: The deck is additive. You are only responsible for completing the slides that are due for the quarter we are in. As the slides are due one (1) month before the end of the quarter. The completed deck should be stored in your correct regions shared folder. Anyone within GitLab has access to search and find this folder. Regional Marketing QBRs Shortly following the day that the regional plans are due, each region will hold its own QBR. The regional Manager of Marketing will be responsible for setting up this meeting and inviting the necessary team members. The point of the QBR is for the Field & Channel Marketing Managers to share their qtrly long plans with their SDR Manager colleagues, Field Marketing colleagues, and Field Marketing Leadership. This time together is meant to be informative and also educational to all who are attending. This deck should also be used to present the regional plans to the sales teams.

In order to ensure the formulas carry over properly, the download from Allocadia will need to be cleaned, similiar to how we clean our leads for list upload. The Calendar cleaner spreadsheet should be used to do this. Once the data is cleaned, it then can be copied into the Marketing Calendar. Video walk through on how to clean. *on GitLab Unfiltered. After the initial pull, the regional marketers are responsible for adding any new tactics for the quarter if we are mid-quarter. If an event is created after this quarterly transfer, the event DRI is responsible for adding the event to the SSoT calendar. Please see the rescheduling or cancellation guidelines for additional details regarding changes or cancellations to existing events. AMER SSoT In the AMER region, managers are responsible for the Marketing SSoT above, but also the AMER SSoT here (internal). Within two days of the quarterly plan being locked by Finance in Allocadia, the AMER Regional Manager will download the team’s plans from Allocadia and will upload to the AMER SSoT (internal). After the initial pull, the regional marketers are responsible for adding all details not included in the pull, any new tactics for the quarter that weren’t pulled from Allocadia, and also moving completed tactics to the Completed Events - Results tab and providing all retrospective information required.

Field Marketing/Channel Marketing Engagement We know and understand the importance of working with our channel partners in region to help build pipeline, and ultimately contribute to closed won business. Jointly with their regionally aligned Channel Marketing Manager & Field Sales teams, Field Marketers should be thinking about which partners will help their sales teams build pipeline in the region and include them in their campaigns. The Field Marketing team will work with channel partners that have successfully Executed at least 3 MDF campaigns in the last 12 months - achieving ROI of 10 x Pipe 2 Spend and targeted # of DRs Booked business threshold. Please revivew the internal handbook for the required threshold of business booked. The Channel Marketing Manager is responsible for keeping track of which partners fall within this category and will support the FM campaign DRI as the link between channel partner and us to ensure a smooth campaign execution on both sides. The complete list of Marketing Channel Partners are identified in SFDC here.

Suggested process: Identify region/area where there is a pipeline need Develop partner campaign objectives and set goal. Set up recurring biweekly cadence with partner, CMM, GitLab sales and FMM to keep planning and campaign action items on track Agree to campaign tactics and persona targets, develop budget request and expected outcomes in the form of Deal Registrations Ensure that you know and understand who/what each team is bringing to the campaign. If there is an invitation involved, ensure that both companies have UTM tracking links to know who has driven who to the event so you all can stay aligned and ensure proper follow ups are taking place. Note: The Channel Partner Enablement team is the DRI to make sure each Partner is fully enabled prior to FMM engagement. FMMs should not be involved in any channel enablement. Funding joint Marketing Campaigns with partners can be: Fully funded by FMM budget Funded jointly by FMM budget and Partner budget We cannot use GitLab MDF dollars to fund joint campaigns. Sample types of activities to engage with partners Workshops Webcast / Lunch and Learn programs Account Acceleration Programs such as executive roundtables Direct Mail Programs Surveys Lead Management in the Channel Please refer to the Channel Partner Joint GitLab events handbook page for details on how we set up our joint campaign and also lead sharing with the channel as a result of those campaings.

Sample types of activities to engage with partners Workshops Webcast / Lunch and Learn programs Account Acceleration Programs such as executive roundtables Direct Mail Programs Surveys Lead Management in the Channel Please refer to the Channel Partner Joint GitLab events handbook page for details on how we set up our joint campaign and also lead sharing with the channel as a result of those campaings. All campaigns we are working with channel partners must flow through the outlined process as a way to ensure we are tracking the success of the campaign properly. Useful Fields in SFDC that relate to Vartopia Please refer to this handbook page for further details. Field Marketing with Alliance Partners AWS Google Register your event with Google If you have a joint event you are running with Google and you would like for their sales and marketing teams to help recruit attendees, you must register your event here. Field Marketing - Public Sector Requesting support for a Public Sector event Requests will be reviewed by the Staff Public Sector Field Marketing Manager. Even if the event is free or low-cost, all requests must be approved by the manager prior to any commitment to ensure the event or tactic aligns to the marketing strategy within the SLA required below, and the team has the resources to support the event. Requirements 60 days notice, prior to the start of the event Support needed from Field Marketing (landing page, swag, invites, etc.) Budget Have we run or sponsored this event in the past? If yes - Please provide ROI details from previous SFDC campaign If no - Please provide valid justification for adding this event to the Field Marketing plan Charitable Donations for Event Attendance As incentive for attending an event, GitLab can promote and process a monetary donation per participant to a charitable organization. For example: GitLab promotes a $25 donation per attendee for attending an event, 100 attendees participate in the event and GitLab donates $2,500 to the selected charity. Please Note: Donations are not to be made in a participant’s name or reference a participant’s organization. All GitLab donations to charitable organizations must follow the Philanthropy Approval Process. PubSec FMM Calendar share In alignment with the PubSec team’s process to lock down shared data that is accessible to teams outside of our US PubSec team - (will link to handbook page once its been created!) the Public Sector Field Marketing Managers, by default, will mark their calendar details as private. Google calendar has a feature that allows you to share your calendar with individuals once its been marketed as private and at a minimum, the FMM team member should share their calendar with both their direct manager as well as their aligned Field Marketing Specialist, pending those people are US Citizens.

FM leadership team will review all requests on a bi-weekly basis, and will prioritize as necessary or will share with you relevant issues if the request is already being worked on. Why we use this template: Funneling similar requests from a global team and addressing shared pain points in a single issue with a DRI will help to reduce noise and churn for other teams we collaborate with and ideally helps to improve a process that works for the WW Field organisation. This issue should not be used as a shortcut to get questions answered but for request where FM leadership can help to improve a process which does contribute to our success as a team. How Field Marketing Tracks Campaign Expenses For information on how Field Marketing tracks campaign expenses, please visit the Marketing handbook page section here.

The Field Marketing Budget Field Marketing manages its budget in Allocadia. Specific instructions on how we manage our expenses: Each FMM will have a quarterly allocation of money to spend based on territory pipeline needs. Every month on t -6 days (so 6 business days before the start of the next month) finance will do a pull of this data and push it into the company planning tool called Adaptive. Field Marketing Managers must always keep their budgets up to date, but it is essential the budget is accurate for the month prior to t -6 days, as FMM Leadership reviews the budget vs. actuals on a monthly basis. Via Geekbot, each FMM will receive a reminder t-8 days before the start of the next month - or 2 days before the monthly forecast is due to Finance. Direct Mail accrual process - Spend should be planned and expensed in the month in which they are sent out to recipients vs. the month in which the recipient could use the direct mail piece, as we have no control over when a gift card (as an example) is used. Survey accrual process - If you are using a 3rd party to complete a survey, it’s the responsibility of the FMM DRI to account for the percent of work that was completed in that month in the budget. As an example, if you signed a contract with a vendor to complete 100 surveys, and in month 1, 50 of the 100 contracted for surveys were completed, then you would account for 50% of the expense in month 1. This update in monthly expense is due to be updated directly in the budget document, in the correct month, in advance of the t -6 days before the end of the month, which is when Finance does a pull of our budget doc to run a budget vs. actuals comparison Content Syndication accrual process - If you are using a 3rd party to run a content syndication play, it’s the responsibility of the FMM DRI to account for the percent of work that was completed in that month in the budget. As an example, if you signed a contract with a vendor to complete 100 leads, and in month 1, 50 of the 100 contracted for leads were delivered, then you would account for 50% of the expense in month 1. This update in monthly expense is due to be updated directly in the budget document, in the correct month, in advance of the t -6 days before the end of the month, which is when Finance does a pull of our budget doc to run a budget vs. actuals comparison The entire cost of the program is to be forecasted for - Sponsorship + lead scanners + monitor + any other auxiliary cost that the company will incur. If the event is just 1 day, then the start and end date would be the same. Any expense that is less than $5,000 USD will be expensed against your budget in the month it is paid. This is in alignment with our GitLab Prepaid Expense Policy. It is essential that you have this expense in the correct month within Allocadia. For expenses more than $5,000 USD (also in alignment with our Accounting rules), we recognize the expense in the month when the work happens, NOT when we the cash leaves our doors. As such, when you are running paid digital ads to support campaign work, you must account for the spend in a separate line item (this is aligned with our practice of creating separate line items for each individual invoice/spend. You will keep the same campaign name for the digital spend, but you will need to account for the different vendor and different time frame in the additional line item. If you are running a campaign that has more than one tactic, and there are specific dates for the tactics, then each tactic will need its own line item in Allocadia. As an example: If you are running a country specific campaign on CI/CD and there are 2 webinars and a workshop included in that campaign with a different specific date, then each webinar and the workshop will need its own tag, in addition to its own line item in the budget. Each folder in Allocadia is protected based on the managers/DRI’s for each region. Only those with permissions will be able to edit each folder. Please reach out in the #allocadia_mktg-budget-holders slack channel if you need permissions updated. At times, expenses are shared across an entire region. These expenses are housed in the ALL region folders. Any activity plans should transfer money to the ALL folder when",

    "content": "the spend in a separate line item (this is aligned with our practice of creating separate line items for each individual invoice/spend. You will keep the same campaign name for the digital spend, but you will need to account for the different vendor and different time frame in the additional line item. If you are running a campaign that has more than one tactic, and there are specific dates for the tactics, then each tactic will need its own line item in Allocadia. As an example: If you are running a country specific campaign on CI/CD and there are 2 webinars and a workshop included in that campaign with a different specific date, then each webinar and the workshop will need its own tag, in addition to its own line item in the budget. Each folder in Allocadia is protected based on the managers/DRI’s for each region. Only those with permissions will be able to edit each folder. Please reach out in the #allocadia_mktg-budget-holders slack channel if you need permissions updated. At times, expenses are shared across an entire region. These expenses are housed in the ALL region folders. Any activity plans should transfer money to the ALL folder when looking to share the cost of expense. The same expense should NOT live in multiple activity plans if its an expense that is shared amongst more than 1 activity plan. As an example: If all regions within AMER want to collaborate on the same campaign and they each want to spend $5k on the campaign, the FMMs would use the transfer budget feature within Allocadia to transfer that money into the All AMER activity plan. Once in All AMER, the correct sub-geos should be selected in the details panel so its clear how this campaign will support the different regions/sub-geos. Transferring to the All folders also prevents FMMs from having to divide out the MQLs amongst the various regions as well for ROI calculation purposes. In order for the shared activity to be pulled into the regional pipeline reporting for QBRs, the FMM will need to remember to also select the ALL folder in addition to their activity plan name in order to pull their full plan noted in reports 3 & 4 here. Video walk through - must be logged into YouTube Unfiltered SFDC campaign owner will be the specific DRI for the overall campaign if running a shared campaign. When splitting a tactic between territories, all money should be transferred to one activity plan and the PO should be raised from that one line item. For budgeting purposes we need to stipulate the amount in USD (as we currently operate in USD) in the FMM budget. Allocadia does have a multi-currency function where you right click in the planned or forecasted sections and the conversion amount is completed for you pulling exchange rates that are loaded on the back end by our finance team. VAT and GST does not need to be included into budget planning as these do not attribute to program expenses, however sales tax in the US does. As it relates to procurement issues being approved, it is essential that the contract details are submitted with the procurement issue, that way the approver is clear about what they are signing off on. We aim for an MQL to not cost us more than $500, should a contract be submitted that is over the $500 goal, there needs to be a documented reason + path to success shown in the procurement issue. It is the responsibility of the FMM Country Manager to ensure this documentation is listed in the procurement issue before the issue is sent on to further leadership to review/approve. For C-level and other campaign where we target decision makers, the customer journey needs to be documented and we acknowledge that the MQL might be higher. Customer Speaker Gifts If you require information about paying for Speaker travel and hotel stay, please refer to this section in the GitLab Event Information page. Please note that there is a limit of $75 USD annually per person on customer speaker gifts. Field Marketing and the Procurement Process Field Marketing Contract Requests In Field Marketing, the FMCs manage all Zip requisitions for their regions. For contracts or invoices ready to submit for approval, the FMM will utilize the Contract Request task in the Asana project and follow the instructions to provide important details required. SLAs The SLA for your FMC to submit your request to Zip/Coupa is 3 business days from when they are assigned the contract request task. Please keep in mind it generally takes a week+ to obtain all approvals and/or signatures during the procurement process (longer for more complicated contracts that may require redlines from legal), so please plan accordingly. Document Review Please make sure you have reviewed your document carefully and have pre-filled the contract details required in the agreement before completing your contract request task in Asana. Below are some items to keep in mind when both the FMMs and FMCs are reviewing contracts… Correct GitLab entity that needs to be utilized, along with the correct address associated with that entity GitLab company name spelled correctly (capital L!) Lead specifics - What contact information will be provided and when? Correct event dates, cost, and sponsorship level Clear vendor goals and if the vendor fails to deliver against T&Cs/goals, a detailed make-good clause If a room block is involved, accurate attrition requirements have been included Month Close Please Note: AP typically closes out the month by the third business day before the last day of the month (Day -3). Once AP closes the month, any charges under $5k (under $50k for swag/shipping) occurring via a credit card or invoice approvals will be reconciled the following month. The month close date will be announced each month in the #allocadia_mktg-budget-holders Slack channel and will also be added to the Marketing Finance Dates Calendar.

    "content": "sure you have reviewed your document carefully and have pre-filled the contract details required in the agreement before completing your contract request task in Asana. Below are some items to keep in mind when both the FMMs and FMCs are reviewing contracts… Correct GitLab entity that needs to be utilized, along with the correct address associated with that entity GitLab company name spelled correctly (capital L!) Lead specifics - What contact information will be provided and when? Correct event dates, cost, and sponsorship level Clear vendor goals and if the vendor fails to deliver against T&Cs/goals, a detailed make-good clause If a room block is involved, accurate attrition requirements have been included Month Close Please Note: AP typically closes out the month by the third business day before the last day of the month (Day -3). Once AP closes the month, any charges under $5k (under $50k for swag/shipping) occurring via a credit card or invoice approvals will be reconciled the following month. The month close date will be announced each month in the #allocadia_mktg-budget-holders Slack channel and will also be added to the Marketing Finance Dates Calendar. Prepaid Policy Please make sure you have reviewed our company’s prepaid policy and have forecasted your cost(s) correctly in Allocadia. Signature Authority GitLab team members DO NOT have signature authority. This means that FMMs are not allowed to sign any legal documents pertaining to quotes, orders, contracts, BEOs, etc. If you have a document that requires a signature, please submit it in a contract request to your FMC to process through procurement. Coupa Card Versus Navan Card This template is to be utilized for all contracts/orders/invoices that either require a signature/acceptance of terms and conditions and/or are over $5,000 in cost. If your order does not require a contract/signature and is under $5,000, you may utilize your Navan credit card for payment. Coupa Card Limits Please be aware that your Coupa card limit is directly associated to the approved PO amount. We have a 10% overage on the card and if you try to charge more than 10% over the PO amount, the card will decline. If you require additional funds be added to the card limit, you will need to request your FMC submit a PO Change Request to increase the PO total and the card limit. Coupa Card Max (Onboarding New Vendors) Please also note, we can only use Coupa cards for POs up to $25,000. Anything over $25,000 requires ACH payment and onboarding the vendor through Zip/Coupa. If you know you have an upcoming contract/payment over $25,000, please contact your FMC in advance so they can check to see if the vendor is currently in Zip/Coupa and if not, they can request the vendor be onboarded in advance by submitting a Zip request. No contract is required to submit this request and an estimated cost can be provided. Please note in the title of the submission that the request is for new vendor onboarding only. For any questions, please reach out to your FMC. Various Charges on Coupa Card If you are submitting various charges for approval on a Coupa virtual card, please make sure you either provide the PDF contract/order/quote or, if ordering through an online portal, please include a screenshot of the items you need to order. Each separate order requires a supporting PDF or screenshot that shows the vendor name, items being ordered, and total cost. These requests will be reviewed during the procurement process and if approved, the Coupa card issued will cover all costs submitted. Only one Allocadia line item is required per Coupa card approved. For example, if you submit a contract request for booth, AV, and IT charges for a show that equal $3,000, you only need one Allocadia line item ID for all three charges and your plan/forecast number would equal $3,000. PLEASE NOTE: These charges follow the prepaid policy and you will always reference the total cost of the charges/PO amount for determining the prepaid threshold. For example, if you submit a $3,000 AV order and a $3,000 booth items order together on one PO, the total PO amount is $6,000. Even though each charge is under the $5k prepaid threshold, the total amount of the PO is $6,000, so you would forecast the charges under the month the event occurs. Multi-Event Contracts We often receive a discount for multiple events and the vendor includes all events under one contract. When this occurs, the FMM will need to create an Allocadia sub-issue and line item for each event and provide all of the Allocadia IDs in the contract request for the FMC. The FMC will submit the contract in ZIP and add separate lines for each event with that specific event’s information and Allocadia ID. PLEASE NOTE: These charges follow the prepaid policy and you will always reference the total cost of the charges/PO amount for determining the prepaid threshold. For example, if you submit a contract for 3 events and each event costs $3,000, the total PO amount is $9,000. Even though each event is under the $5k prepaid threshold, the total amount of the PO is $9,000, so you would forecast each event charge under the month the event occurs. F&B/AV/Additional Event Charges Since we often don’t have the exact headcount for an event in advance, additional costs (such as AV, F&B, etc.) can be estimated for initial procurement approval. If your additional costs are included in the initial venue contract, please ask the venue to provide pricing for your estimated headcount in the contract (especially for F&B costs, so that you are not only submitting your F&B minimum). This will give us a baseline cost estimate for approval and your FMC will adjust the PO amount as needed, based on final cost (a PO change request will be issued for charges above 10% over the original PO amount). If your additional costs (catering, AV, etc.) are being provided by different vendors from the venue, please make sure",

    "content": "the prepaid policy and you will always reference the total cost of the charges/PO amount for determining the prepaid threshold. For example, if you submit a contract for 3 events and each event costs $3,000, the total PO amount is $9,000. Even though each event is under the $5k prepaid threshold, the total amount of the PO is $9,000, so you would forecast each event charge under the month the event occurs. F&B/AV/Additional Event Charges Since we often don’t have the exact headcount for an event in advance, additional costs (such as AV, F&B, etc.) can be estimated for initial procurement approval. If your additional costs are included in the initial venue contract, please ask the venue to provide pricing for your estimated headcount in the contract (especially for F&B costs, so that you are not only submitting your F&B minimum). This will give us a baseline cost estimate for approval and your FMC will adjust the PO amount as needed, based on final cost (a PO change request will be issued for charges above 10% over the original PO amount). If your additional costs (catering, AV, etc.) are being provided by different vendors from the venue, please make sure you have separate Allocadia line items for those charges and also submit separate contract requests (if a contract is required by the vendors). If the vendor does not require a contract and charges are under $5,000, you can pay with your Navan card. Sourcing New Field Marketing Vendors Field marketers are always looking for new ways to support the sales teams within their regions and to provide unique, alternative ways to draw potential prospects closer to our company and show value to our current customers in order to expand within those accounts. Field marketers have a vast tool kit of marketing initiatives for precisely that. However, sometimes a gap is identified and field marketers will look to external third party vendors to help fill that gap when it comes to achieving their goals to their marketing metrics. When souring and selecting a new third-party vendor, there are a few things that should be considered: What are you trying to achieve? What is the gap you have identified? Is it filling the top of the funnel? Building relationships within a specific target audience (i.e. C-Level)? Maybe your goal is delivering on more qualified leads? Be clear on your end goal(s) from the beginning. Can this vendor achieve your goal? Have the vendor show you proven use cases and references on your specific goals. Have you sourced more than 1 vendor? A good point of reference is to research at least 2 or 3. Is this vendor willing to proceed with a pilot program with you? Even with the best intentions, not all 3rd party vendors will fulfill your needs as originally discussed. A pilot program will allow you to try out the vendor and/or their product without requiring a full investment up front. Identify all of the pieces of the contract. Ensure that you and the 3rd party vendor are aligned on the following: Cost Timeline of project Timeline of onboarding What is required when it comes to integration - Full Access, No Access or Partial Access What are your deliverables? What are their deliverables? Identify who needs to be trained. What does that training involve? Who will be the DRI for the project (always have 1 person who will support you during your contract process)? What is the cost of renewal, or, if you are running a pilot, what is the cost of a full term contract? If you’re running a pilot, what are the goals you have in place to determine if you should invest beyond the pilot phase? Once you feel confident that you have chosen the right 3rd party vendor, now is the time to begin the following review process. Working with vendors that are brand new New vendors are popping up frequently and in the spirit of iteration and testing, the Field Marketing team at time may want to engage with a vendor that is brand new to the space (remember, at one point in time way back in 2011, GitLab the company was brand new too!). You should work with your leader to assess these opportunities. To ensure we are protecting our own company, you should follow these steps when working with a brand new vendor: If contacted via social media or other manner by an unknown individual and/or individual(s) related to an event, review all event/program materials, including a detailed review of the organizers website to confirm past events. In addition, review various social media materials. If an event is unknown, new or first time, the Team Member can engage with Alliance and Channel Team Members to gather feedback on the events organizer and ensure value, use your netowrk internally and ask around if folks know this vendor. Where applicable, request details and documentation related to previous event(s) hosted by the organizer. In situations where an organizer is hosting an inaugural event, Team Members can ask for other partners / sponsors who are participating, and receive direct confirmation from the event space host (e.g, hotel). In situations with first events, the field marketing team can engage the GitLab Legal Team for additional review. Video walk through with our legal team outlining this process can be found on GitLab Unfiltered. Software Vendor/Product Approval Process FMM and FMC to review the Procurement Handbook Page so you are familiar with the procurement process and lead times. Please be aware of the SLAs listed in the Procurement Process for processing all reviews, approvals and contract negotiations. Note the bid process based on thresholds as well. FMM to open a Field Marketing issue and detail out the justification for the potential new vendor/product. Include any presentations, slides and demos that have been provided to help explain the product. Tag your regional manager in the issue to review and discuss. Approval must be received to move forward. Make sure to",

    "content": "ensure value, use your netowrk internally and ask around if folks know this vendor. Where applicable, request details and documentation related to previous event(s) hosted by the organizer. In situations where an organizer is hosting an inaugural event, Team Members can ask for other partners / sponsors who are participating, and receive direct confirmation from the event space host (e.g, hotel). In situations with first events, the field marketing team can engage the GitLab Legal Team for additional review. Video walk through with our legal team outlining this process can be found on GitLab Unfiltered. Software Vendor/Product Approval Process FMM and FMC to review the Procurement Handbook Page so you are familiar with the procurement process and lead times. Please be aware of the SLAs listed in the Procurement Process for processing all reviews, approvals and contract negotiations. Note the bid process based on thresholds as well. FMM to open a Field Marketing issue and detail out the justification for the potential new vendor/product. Include any presentations, slides and demos that have been provided to help explain the product. Tag your regional manager in the issue to review and discuss. Approval must be received to move forward. Make sure to attach all of the following issues to your main Field Marketing Issue for easy access. FMM to open a Contract Request issue and assign to the regional FMC. SLA for FMC to complete the Contract Request issue is 3 business days from the date all needed info is filled out by the FMM in the Contract Request issue. FMM to leave a note if turnaround is urgent (FMCs have been averaging 1-2 business days currently). FMC to process an NDA with the vendor, specified in the procurement handbook here. Remember to attach your executed NDA when opening your Zip requisition in the steps below. If you’re requesting a new software tool, FMM to open a Marketing Ops Tools Eval issue. Marketing Ops will help evaluate the product and will assist in the procurement process. They will also help you determine if an integration is required with any products in our current tech stack and if so, which team will be the DRI for the integration. FMC to follow these instructions for opening a Zip requisition. Please note that you can submit the Zip requisition even before a contract has been provided. This template details the following approvals: NDA requirement Privacy review (if applicable) Security review Tech stack request (for new software purchases) If you’re requesting a new tool, and if the new product requires integration with any of our existing products (SFDC, Marketo, Outreach, etc.) FMC to open an integration request issue with the appropriate team (see step above where the Marketing Ops team will help determine). Integration will not begin until all approvals are final and the contract has been fully executed, but opening the integration issue early will give the appropriate team advance notice for planning. Field Marketing and Legal Legal Approvals Field Marketing executes contracts with outside vendors to support the work we do. We do so by following the company procure to pay process. All legal approvals will flow this process. It should be a rare occasion (and not a result of poor planning), that a contract would need to be urgently (less than 5 business days) turned around. Only after all FMM approvals have happened, should the FMC ping legal on slack asking them to please approve an urgent ask. Sweepstakes Field Marketing follows the legal team’s process here for contests and sweepstakes. Field Marketing Communications Regional Email Aliases Field Marketing utilizes regional email aliases for pre and post tactic outreach. Please see this section for more details. Slack Rooms we use #fieldmarketing - open to all teams to ask questions to field marketing & where weekly stand-up reports get posted to. If you’re an employee at GitLab trying to reach Field Marketing, please head over to our slack channel. NOTE: If you’re requesting we sponsor an event, instructions can be found here. If a region specific question is asked in the #fieldmarketing slack room, please tag the regional Field Marketing leader, as that person is the DRI. #fieldmarketing-fyi - Official channel for Field Marketing Leadership to post announcements to the Field Marketing team. Restricted permission levels to only FMM Leadership posting the announcements Announcements can be submitted to your manager if you would like to something shared All members have comment access to allow clarifications if needed on a thread You are to react with an emoji (thumbs-up, eyes…) to signal to managers that you’ve seen an announcement There should be no need to cross-post announcements (such as posting a link from another slack channel to the #fieldmarketing channel) With a #company-fyi and the #fieldmarketing-fyi, all relevant info should be successfully communicated by managers to team members. Default to issues first, then public channels when possible to avoid siloing work information to private discussions. Use DMs for personal, private conversation rather than work communication (unless you are certain it is only relevant to the 2 of you or you need immediate attention). #fieldofdreamsteam: private room only accessible to FMMs - funny GIFs, private questions for the team. Please keep in mind we have detailed instructions on how GitLab uses slack. Async Status Updates Since we are a remote company, we utilize a Slack plugin called Geekbot to coordinate status updates. Field Marketing world wide currently conducts 1 weekly standup. Geekbot shares this update in the public #im-hangout slack room. Weekly Status Update The Weekly Status Update is configured to run at 9 AM local time on Monday, and contains a series of rotating questions. Below is an example of questions you may see: What was your favorite part of the weekend? The goal with this question is for you to get to know your colleagues and for you to be able to share what excited you from the previous few days when you weren’t working. Are you traveling anywhere this week? If so, where",

    "content": "to team members. Default to issues first, then public channels when possible to avoid siloing work information to private discussions. Use DMs for personal, private conversation rather than work communication (unless you are certain it is only relevant to the 2 of you or you need immediate attention). #fieldofdreamsteam: private room only accessible to FMMs - funny GIFs, private questions for the team. Please keep in mind we have detailed instructions on how GitLab uses slack. Async Status Updates Since we are a remote company, we utilize a Slack plugin called Geekbot to coordinate status updates. Field Marketing world wide currently conducts 1 weekly standup. Geekbot shares this update in the public #im-hangout slack room. Weekly Status Update The Weekly Status Update is configured to run at 9 AM local time on Monday, and contains a series of rotating questions. Below is an example of questions you may see: What was your favorite part of the weekend? The goal with this question is for you to get to know your colleagues and for you to be able to share what excited you from the previous few days when you weren’t working. Are you traveling anywhere this week? If so, where and why. <— This question is paused for the moment. :) As Field Marketers, we travel up to 50% of the time. Sharing where you are is important, especially if are in a different timezone. What are your top 1-3 priorities for the next week? These top 3 priorities should be focused on what you plan to accomplish that week. Anything blocking your progress? Of those 1-3 items listed, do you need any roadblocks removed in order to accomplish the priorities? A question that is related to which GitLab Value we are focusing on for the month. You will be notified via the Geekbot plug in on slack at 9 AM your local time on Mondays, as stated above. It is important to note, that unless you answer all questions in the Geekbot plug in, your answers will NOT be shared with your colleagues, so please be sure to complete all questions! Out of Office Process We follow the processes documented in the Communicating your time off section of our handbook page. Please follow the below instructions. WORKDAY: Add your OOO to Workday COVERAGE: Notify both your manager and the person covering for you that you will be out of the office. Make sure the person covering for you has all important details needed while you are away. GMAIL: Add an OOO message for your email. Please ensure you include the contact information of the person covering for you. ASANA: Go to your Asana settings and toggle on Set Out of Office and fill in OOO dates. Then, go to the About Me section and specify the dates you are OOO and who can be contacted as your backup support for any reviews, approvals, etc. GOOGLE CALENDAR: Turn on Google Calendar’s out of office setting (scroll down to “Show when you’re out of office”) to create an out of office event that will automatically decline new and existing meetings for you. Or, please ensure to manually cancel/decline/reschedule any meetings if you will not be in attendance. SLACK: When you submit your OOO through Workday, an OOO notification will automatically be added to your Slack the days you are out. If you’re traveling for an event and not necessarily on PTO/vacation, please ensure you are manually updating your Slack status accordingly. If your time off was added in Workday, Time off by Deel in Slack will also prompt you to add a delegate who will be covering for you. Please fill in this information so it’s clear in Slack who people can contact in your absense. GITLAB: Add an OOO to your GitLab profile and mark yourself as busy ZIP: If you work in ZIP, please assign a delegate by going to ZIP - Settings - Personal Settings - Out of Office COUPA: If you work in Coupa, please assign a delegate in Coupa so you will not hold approvals while you’re enjoying your time off. MDF: If you are an MDF approver, please see handbook details here. Field Marketing MR process Everyone can contribute, although not everyone has merge rights. Within the Field Marketing team, when someone submits an MR, the submitter needs to assign to their direct line manager to review, and then their manager will assign to the VP of Regional Marketing to review. Once the VP has reviewed/approved, it is their responsibility to ensure all threads are addressed and resolved and all merge conflicts are resolved, then merge. Should a Country Manager of Regional Marketing or VP of Regional Marketing submit a process change in the handbook, then all Country Managers should sign off via approving the MR or commenting their approval. At which point, the Director ensures all threads are addressed and resolved and all merge conflicts are resolved, then the VP will merge. Creating a spif for sales At times, Field Marketers may want to create a SPIF (sales performance incentive fund) to help drive sales behavior in a campaign they are running. While this should not be our standard to offer a SPIF, should one need to be used, we do need to report back to payroll any incentive that was paid and to who. The process is as follows: There is no payment threshold that would not need to be reported. All SPIFs must be reported. The SPIF DRI should send the legal name of the winners to payroll The SPIF DRI should include the amount of money (or value of the prize, if a prize was offered) to payroll Contact info for payroll can be found here on their handbook page.

Creating a spif for sales At times, Field Marketers may want to create a SPIF (sales performance incentive fund) to help drive sales behavior in a campaign they are running. While this should not be our standard to offer a SPIF, should one need to be used, we do need to report back to payroll any incentive that was paid and to who. The process is as follows: There is no payment threshold that would not need to be reported. All SPIFs must be reported. The SPIF DRI should send the legal name of the winners to payroll The SPIF DRI should include the amount of money (or value of the prize, if a prize was offered) to payroll Contact info for payroll can be found here on their handbook page.

FMM to assign FMC in main event issue. FMC to attach their regional event tracking label to the event issue. FMM and FMC to follow the process for issues Moving from Plan to WIP. FMC to create a Write Copy Issue and fill in the requested copy due dates for each asset the FMM has requested in the FMC checklist, and then attach the issue to the epic. FMM to update the Copy Document file the FMC created for them (linked in the epic) with copy for each asset. Previous Copy Documents for reference are available in the Event Support Folder. Once the FMM completes copy, they will ping the FMC in the Write Copy Issue to notify them which asset copy has been completed. If copy has not been completed for an asset yet, (1) business day before copy is due, the FMC will ping the FMM in Write Copy Issue with a copy due reminder. FMC will make sure copy has been provided or continue to remind the FMM, if needed. Lead List Deadline Process FMC to create the List Clean and Upload issue during the plan to WIP process. FMC to assign a due date of 2 business days post-event One (1) business day after the issue is due, FMC to ping the FMM in the list clean and upload issue to remind them leads are due FMC will make sure leads have been provided or continue to remind the FMM, if needed Refined AMER Regional Marketing Event Planning Cycle The schedule provided below presents a 20-week planning timeline meticulously designed for the seamless execution of our regional marketing events.

Ultimately, the unwavering dedication of our team will serve as the cornerstone of success for each event. 17-20 Weeks Out: Strategize and Initiate Planning At this stage, we lay the groundwork for a successful event by creating a well-defined strategy and rallying key players. Initiate strategic collaboration with Sales to align event goals and strategies. Define clear event objectives, messaging, target audience, and desired outcomes. Secure unwavering buy-in from essential stakeholders to ensure full support. Develop a comprehensive campaign plan using Allocadia, continually monitoring the budget. Compile all available details into a comprehensive Main Issue.-* Secure required third-party vendors if necessary, and create vendor contract request issue(s). 14-17 Weeks Out: Resource Alignment and Team Coordination During this phase, we focus on coordinating resources and refining our strategies to meet evolving needs. Review and approve contract requests for event vendors. Request team member resources based on event needs.(SA,BDR, SDR, CS, Design, Internal - Speakers etc) when required use specific team request issues as needed.. Continue collaborating with Sales to refine goals and strategies. Schedule meetings with relevant team members to outline their contributions to the plan. Please continue to revise the issue, providing comprehensive updates that capture all plan details and ensuring that",

    "content": "unwavering dedication of our team will serve as the cornerstone of success for each event. 17-20 Weeks Out: Strategize and Initiate Planning At this stage, we lay the groundwork for a successful event by creating a well-defined strategy and rallying key players. Initiate strategic collaboration with Sales to align event goals and strategies. Define clear event objectives, messaging, target audience, and desired outcomes. Secure unwavering buy-in from essential stakeholders to ensure full support. Develop a comprehensive campaign plan using Allocadia, continually monitoring the budget. Compile all available details into a comprehensive Main Issue.-* Secure required third-party vendors if necessary, and create vendor contract request issue(s). 14-17 Weeks Out: Resource Alignment and Team Coordination During this phase, we focus on coordinating resources and refining our strategies to meet evolving needs. Review and approve contract requests for event vendors. Request team member resources based on event needs.(SA,BDR, SDR, CS, Design, Internal - Speakers etc) when required use specific team request issues as needed.. Continue collaborating with Sales to refine goals and strategies. Schedule meetings with relevant team members to outline their contributions to the plan. Please continue to revise the issue, providing comprehensive updates that capture all plan details and ensuring that all key stakeholders are appropriately tagged.

Ensure all lead information is accurate and ready for upload Upload event leads Within 48 hours, ensure that a follow-up email is scheduled to be sent to attendees with relevant call-to-action resources.\" Wrap up and close campaign issue and archive relevant materials. 1-2 Weeks Post Event: Evolving for the Future With one event completed, it's time to reflect, plan, and optimize for the upcoming campaigns. Reflect on the successes and challenges of the planning process. Initiate discussions and brainstorming for the upcoming quarter’s planning and strategy. Identify opportunities for enhancement and refinement in future endeavors. Begin planning for the next successful event, incorporating lessons learned Printfection Direct Mail Giveaways We will be deprecating usage of Printfection and will use Reachdesk or our selected swag vendor for direct mail. Expand below to see details regarding Printfection The below steps can be followed to set up and run a giveaway campaign using Printfection for field marketing. If you come across any steps that you can’t follow in Printfection, post in the #swag Slack channel so a Community Advocate can update your permissions levels. Register and send the items you will be using to Printfection by following these steps Bundle your items together by creating a Giveaway Kit in Printfection The picture of the Giveaway Kit is what the customer will see. If you’d like a different image to show than what Printfection puts together as a preview, be sure to provide this to the support team Select Standard packaging or choose to create a custom box (a new custom box will incur additional expenses). If you’d like to use already created custom packaging (such as the GitLab branded Poly Mailers), check with the advocates in the #swag slack channel to make sure it’s okay for you to use Set up a Giveaway Campaign Add the kit you created as an item in the Giveaway Campaign The name of the giveaway campaign will be visible to the customer Change from Paused to Running when you’re ready to run the campaign Add a Printfection code column to your event spreadsheet with your leads. Copy over unique codes (generated above in the Printfection Giveaway Campaign) to assign a code to each lead Work with your MPM to set up the Printfection URL & unique codes in your email copy (if desired, steps 5-7 are only relevant if sending a Marketo email rather than individually distributing the redemption links): Place the Giveaway Campaign URL in your email copy (found on the Overview tab of the campaign in Printfection) A custom Marketo field will be used to append the unique Printfection codes to the URL for each lead (example of how it works here) and to place the code under the URL Complete list upload prior to the email send date (example list upload here) Work with your MPM to determine post redemption email needs. The options are follow up email and an automated confirmation email. The confirmation email triggers upon redemption of codes, the follow up email is sent at one time to a group of recipients. If an automated confirmation email is needed, define what status in SFDC should trigger the follow up email using the Direct Mail campaign status progressions. (for example, when a person’s campaign status changes to Queued it could trigger a confirmation email and when the status changes to Shipped the SDRs will begin follow up sequence (example here) Once all above steps are complete, the Giveaway Campaign is ready to run. Make sure the Giveaway is changed from Paused to Running if you did not do this already in Step 3 When the campaign is running, monitor Redemptions, Shipping, and Costs under the Giveaway Campaign Overview in Printfection Update redemptions/shipments in event spreadsheet if needed to notify SDRs (add additional columns to track) Update SFDC status for leads once they redeem a code or item is shipped, depending on what was decided in Step 7 When a campaign is over and you no longer need the items in Printfection, follow these steps to remove items from Printfection. If inventory is not yet 0, you will need to ship the items back to yourself/desired recipient before archiving. Until this is done, $25/month will still be charged per item. If relevant, the MPM must be instructed as to when the Printfection codes are no longer needed on person records.

    "content": "when the Printfection codes are no longer needed on person records. This will signal that the MPM can now run a batch smart campaign to remove the Printfection codes from the person records, thus freeing up the custom field for use in the future. Fees Involved: Cost of the items you are using in the giveaway Fulfillment and shipping fees for each order placed once the giveaway is running (there is a Cost Estimate under campaign settings but please note actuals have ended up higher than their estimate so far) These will be on a Printfection invoice, more details to come on the invoice process. $25/month per item stocked in Printfection. This will not hit your field marketing Allocadia ID, but is an overall cost to GitLab to consider and be mindful of (noted in Step 12 here Account-Centric Micro-Campaign Expand below to see details regarding Account-Centric Micro-Campaigns The purpose of the regional integrated micro-campaign is to build and drive a specific strategy in a region (with a specific list of targeted accounts/look-a-like accounts). This could be based on intent data pulled from our ABM tool, DemandBase, or it could be based on accounts you’ve agreed to target with your SAE. A micro-campaign must include a minimum of 2 different account-centric tactics. For example: If you are planning a virtual Lunch & Learn and want to utilize LinkedIn InMail as well, those 2 account-centric tactics together make up a micro-campaign. However, if you are planning a Lunch & Learn on its own without any additional tactics, that is just considered an individual tactic. What does Account-Centric mean? At times, Field Marketing will run an account-centric approach to its in-region campaigns. Account-Centric is an approach where both sales and marketing are focusing their efforts on a very specific list of targeted accounts in order to increase engagement and ultimately pipeline creation within this list of accounts. The SAE/FMM/SDR are responsible for outlining which accounts are account-centric and accounts can easily pop in and out of being in the account-centric play based on the strategy that’s being executed. i.e. If a FMM is targeting to get 15 people into an interactive roundtable discussion, that will greatly impact the number of accounts that are targeted for that specific tactic vs if they were trying to 100+ people into that same discussion. How to track the ROI of your Account-Centric approach In order to track engagement, you need to start with a baseline and over time, track the progress on how engaged that account is with us. Right now this is a manual process where this SFDC report should be modified by pulling in all the accounts that are in the account-centric GTM Strategy per rep and then you must take a snap shot in time (SFDC does not allow for historical data pulls) by exporting the data and saving to a gsheet. Example of gsheet. Depending on your campaign, you can export this data on a weekly or monthly cadence to monitor progress. In order to change the GTM Strategy field for accounts in SFDC from Volume to Account-Centric, you can employ two options: a) Change the GTM Strategy field for each account manually if you have <20 accounts in the campaign, or b) Create a MOps request to have all accounts changed from Volume to Account-Centric in bulk. To request the bulk adjustment, please utilize this MOps template. Account-Centric is different from Account Based Marketing in the sense that ABM focuses on accounts as markets of one versus account-centric targeting a group of accounts. At GitLab we run a 3-Tiered approach to ABM focused around our ICP and target 100-150 accounts in our ABM strategy at any given time. For complete details on how GitLab runs its Account Based Marketing, please head to the GitLab ABM page. At GitLab, we utilize Bizible for attribution tracking. In order to track the touchpoints of your campaign, modify this linear IACV SFDC report . This report shows Opportunity: Incremental ACV and Linear iACV. If your campaign has a SFDC campaign with leads associated to it, then you will pull in the SFDC Field Salesforce Campaign equals . If your campaign does NOT have a SFDC Campaign with leads associated OR you also are wanting to track the opportunities from your digital spend, then you would add in the SFDC Ad Campaign Name equals . We use the same UTM per channel, so all channels (paid ads, LinkedIn Mail, DemandBase, etc.) will pull all influenced iacv. Stay tuned for more details on Bizible. Account-Centric Micro-Campaign Team Field Marketing Manager - overarching DRI responsible for opening the micro-campaign issue, reviewing the intent data from the ABM DRI, and building the strategy based on what the intent data is suggesting (i.e. are a lot of folks searching to Kubernetes? Is it digital transformation? What call to action do we have? Do you want a direct mail piece involved? Do you want to drive to an On-Demand or scheduled webcast?), owning, and driving the mico-campaign, including epic and issue creation and communicating timelines and actions needed of other team members with relevant SLAs from request to delivery. Account Based Marketing (ABM) Manager - will work with FMM to produce target account list based on intent data and known targets & will also lead strategy session with Demandbase Campaign Manager, should the FMM decided its part of the strategy to deploy ads via Demandbase. Sales Development Rep (SDR) - Will assist in building out the actual target people & build Outreach cadence to support agreed upon CTA. Digital Marketing Programs - Can assist in deploying paid digital strategies (ex: display ads, paid search, paid social, and/or paid publisher placement) and geo focused ads via our digital agency. They can also help get our digital agency involved should the FMM want to engage with the agency.

Do you want to drive to an On-Demand or scheduled webcast?), owning, and driving the mico-campaign, including epic and issue creation and communicating timelines and actions needed of other team members with relevant SLAs from request to delivery. Account Based Marketing (ABM) Manager - will work with FMM to produce target account list based on intent data and known targets & will also lead strategy session with Demandbase Campaign Manager, should the FMM decided its part of the strategy to deploy ads via Demandbase. Sales Development Rep (SDR) - Will assist in building out the actual target people & build Outreach cadence to support agreed upon CTA. Digital Marketing Programs - Can assist in deploying paid digital strategies (ex: display ads, paid search, paid social, and/or paid publisher placement) and geo focused ads via our digital agency. They can also help get our digital agency involved should the FMM want to engage with the agency. Marketing Program Managers - Setup of Marketo and Salesforce campaigns with correct program type to support the tactic. Guidance on system tracking, and setup of Marketo email follow up. Facilitate new program types with MOps and other MPMs as necessary. Steps for the Creation and Organization of Micro-Campaign Epics & Issues 1. FMM opens overarching issue FMM opens a field marketing issue using the Micro-Campaign and Individual Tactics Template, listing the tactics to be used from the list below in step 2. At this point, the issue is in PLAN stage. WHY? The purpose of opening the overarching micro-campaign issue is to discuss the plan with any teams that would require work and gain agreement on SLAs before opening epics and issues. Remember - as of today, epics cannot be made confidential, they cannot show up on issue boards, and there is no such thing as an epic template. Here is what needs to be included before moving from PLAN to WIP: Agreement on SLAs and scope between other teams involved in selected tactics - SLA workback doc Formulation of a clear strategy and understanding of customer journey Completion of all fields in the Details section of the micro-campaign template For anything that’s listed in the Tactics included section of the template the FMM needs to be clear about their specific ask & what the desired outcome will be. If the FMM does not know, it’s ok to set up a call to talk through ideas and strategies. 2. FMM opens specific tactic issues FMM opens additional issues relevant to their micro-campaign, if required. WHY? The purpose of opening the issue is so that each individual tactic shows up on the FMM boards. Remember - as of today, Epics cannot be made confidential, they cannot show up on issue boards, and there is no such thing as an epic template. Issue Templates for Each Tactic: Please see the Field Marketing Issue Templates and Epic Codes list HERE for a comprehensive list of templates to be utilized for each tactic. 3. FMM creates tactic epics FMM follows the instructions for epic creation based on the tactics decided. WHY? The purpose of opening the epics and issues is to organize the campaign in GitLab with the epic being equivalent to the project/campaign and issues being equivalent to the tactical execution steps to complete the campaign. How to create the epic: Where to create the epic: Marketing Epic Repo How to create the epic: Click “New Epic” at the top right of the screen What to name the epic: The naming convention is listed in the epic code for each specific tactic. What to choose as the due date: this should be the same as your micro-campaign issue due date. For example - If your micro-campaign involves 3 different tactics and the last tactic is set to close out on December 5, 2020, that should be your due date. How to link the epic to the issue: In your epic click on Epics + Issues - Add - Add an existing issue - Link your issue Micro-Campaign Epic Code This epic will include the general details of your micro-campaign. <--- Name this epic using the following format, then delete this line: [Micro-Campaign Tactic Name] - [3-letter Month] [Date], [Year] ---> ## [Micro-Campaign Issue >>]() ## :notepad_spiral: Details (copy and pasted from your micro-campaign issue) /label ~\"mktg-status::wip\" ~\"Field Marketing\" ~\"FMM-MicroCampaign\" ~\"FMM-Other Tactics\" Epic Codes for Each Tactic: Please see the Field Marketing Issue Templates and Epic Codes list HERE for a comprehensive list of epic codes to be utilized for each tactic. 4. FMM creates relevant issues and assigns DRIs and due dates At this point the FMM has the main issue (for agreement by teams), the tactic issue(s) (to show up on boards), and the tactic epics (to capture overarching tactic plan and organize issues). Now FMMs will create the issues to request the work and timeline of teams involved in each tactic. In each epic code (from step 3), there are issue template links included that indicate what issues need to be created (example - follow up email, facilitate tracking, etc.) - if they do not say “optional” then they are required. The FMM will create each issue and link to the epic so that all tactical issues are organized together clearly in GitLab. The FMM will designate DRI as indicated and set due dates based on SLAs for each item that is being requested. SLA workback sheet is available to help you. Note: This is essentially creating the work-back execution plan using issues, DRIs, and due dates. If the date of the tactic is changed, the FMM is responsible for updating the due dates of all issues accordingly. It is also important to remember that the DRIs on the issues are not notified when due dates are added. If you create an issue and then add due dates at a later time (or change due dates),",

    "content": "(to show up on boards), and the tactic epics (to capture overarching tactic plan and organize issues). Now FMMs will create the issues to request the work and timeline of teams involved in each tactic. In each epic code (from step 3), there are issue template links included that indicate what issues need to be created (example - follow up email, facilitate tracking, etc.) - if they do not say “optional” then they are required. The FMM will create each issue and link to the epic so that all tactical issues are organized together clearly in GitLab. The FMM will designate DRI as indicated and set due dates based on SLAs for each item that is being requested. SLA workback sheet is available to help you. Note: This is essentially creating the work-back execution plan using issues, DRIs, and due dates. If the date of the tactic is changed, the FMM is responsible for updating the due dates of all issues accordingly. It is also important to remember that the DRIs on the issues are not notified when due dates are added. If you create an issue and then add due dates at a later time (or change due dates), please remember to ping the DRIs in the issue so they are aware dates have been added or changed. 5. Organizing Epics Your micro-campaign issue and epic is an overview of your micro-campaign strategy and each individual tactic supporting the micro-campaign requires its own issue and epic. When you add individual tactic epics to the micro-campaign epic, the micro-campaign epic automatically becomes the Parent Epic. Each individual tactic epic, when nested under the micro-campaign epic, automatically becomes the Child Epic. Whichever epic you nest the other epics under will automatically become the Parent Epic, so remember to always add your individual tactic epics to the micro-campaign epic and not the other way around. For example - You have created a micro-campaign that will include a self-service event with promotion, a survey, LinkedIn InMail, and DemandBase targeted ads. You will create an epic for your micro-campaign per the above instructions. Your self-service event with promotion will require a separate issue with its own epic. Your survey will also require a separate issue with its own epic. Your LinkedIn InMail will require its own issue (the only DMP tactic that currently requires an epic is Content Syndication). Your DemandBase ads will require its own issue (ABM tactics do not currently require epics). To organize your various tactic epics under your micro-campaign epic: Click into your micro-campaign epic Scroll down to Epics & Issues Click Add an Epic Paste the epics from your other tactics into this section and GitLab will automatically organize the tactic epics under your micro-campaign epic Micro-Campaign Training Video Video training on how to set up a Micro-Campaign. This video walks you though how to set up a Self Service webcast with promotion and LinkedIn InMail. Two tactics = Micro Campaign. Example Micro-Campaign for Training Micro-Campaign Epic Micro-Campaign FM Issue Self-Service Virtual Event with promotion Epic Self-Service Virtual Event with Promotion FM Issue Follow Up Issue Invites and Reminders Issue List Clean and Upload Issue Facilitate Tracking Issue Paid Survey Epic (No separate FM issue since information is in overall Micro-Campaign Issue) Gated Content Request Issue Follow Up Issue Facilitate Tracking Issue LinkedIn Inmail Issue (No epic required) DemandBase Targeted Ads Issue (No epic required) FAQ’s - Micro Campaigns and Other Tactics If I am only running 1 tactic, do I need to create the micro campaign issue? Answer: No, you do not. A microcampaign includes at least 2 account centric tactics. If I want to run ads through our ABM vendor do I need to create a micro campaign issue? Answer: No, you do not. A microcampaign includes at least 2 account centric tactics. Ads with our ABM vendor is only 1 tactic. Reminders - Micro Campaigns and Other Tactics Labels - be aware of your labels. Please be mindful that you’re adding the correct labels. Epic label issue - There is a glitch right now which may keep the labels from auto-assigning. In order to have the labels added to your epic, you’ll need to copy the /label line from the epic code into a comment to pull over all labels. Quick video how-to. 2 mins If you create an epic & sub issues and DO NOT have a date, then when you go back and add dates then you MUST ping the assigners - could be FMC, MPM, OPS, etc. When you go from plan to WIP that’s when everything starts - from the SLA workback as well. The details section is so important - what that tells the MPM/FMC how this program should flow. You can’t move your issue to the WIP stage until the details are added - This is where if attention to detail isn’t your BFF, you need to make it your BFF. ;) SimplyDirect Expand below to see details regarding SimplyDirect Overview SimplyDirect is a third party company that helps companies identify buyers and early adopters using the latest in big data tools and high-response surveys. The program from SimplyDirect includes surveying (through GatePoint Research), responder intelligence, and custom content creation in the shape of a Pulse Report highlighting the overall findings from survey responses. These custom built surveys are developed via collaboration with GitLab sellers, Product Marketing, and Sales Development Reps, where the aim is to target accounts to create actionable sales intelligence which reveals an account’s needs, pain, plans and trends. In addition, GatePoint Research provides an incentive of a free gift upon completing the survey. Our strategy is to leverage the data from the survey responses as well as the Pulse Report provided to set meetings and create sales-accepted opportunities. The data gathered from the surveys will also help the Digital Marketing Team and Campaign Managers by providing insight into the respondents current state of DevOps use and strategy as well as pain points and challenges.

    "content": "details are added - This is where if attention to detail isn’t your BFF, you need to make it your BFF. ;) SimplyDirect Expand below to see details regarding SimplyDirect Overview SimplyDirect is a third party company that helps companies identify buyers and early adopters using the latest in big data tools and high-response surveys. The program from SimplyDirect includes surveying (through GatePoint Research), responder intelligence, and custom content creation in the shape of a Pulse Report highlighting the overall findings from survey responses. These custom built surveys are developed via collaboration with GitLab sellers, Product Marketing, and Sales Development Reps, where the aim is to target accounts to create actionable sales intelligence which reveals an account’s needs, pain, plans and trends. In addition, GatePoint Research provides an incentive of a free gift upon completing the survey. Our strategy is to leverage the data from the survey responses as well as the Pulse Report provided to set meetings and create sales-accepted opportunities. The data gathered from the surveys will also help the Digital Marketing Team and Campaign Managers by providing insight into the respondents current state of DevOps use and strategy as well as pain points and challenges. Regions that Utilize Simply Direct At this time, SimplyDirect is only used by our AMER Field Marketing team. Successful Usage Strategic success is contingent upon close alignment and communication between Marketing and Sales. Marketing will work collaboratively with Sales, Product Marketing and Campaign Managers to develop the survey. Best practice for the survey is 10 questions max. SDR’s will create a follow-up Outreach sequence to leverage when reaching out to those who’ve completed the survey. Once the survey is complete, SDR’s will leverage the individual results and work with their SAE to: Identify points of interest in the survey pertaining to each individual response (i.e. pain points, number of tools, etc) Create a strategy based on matching those issues with GitLab offerings Customize their outreach communications to initiate conversations towards setting a IQM Personas Our focus will be geared towards key-decision makers or fellow team members who can help push to key decision makers. This opens up our outreach to anyone in DevOps, DevSecOps, IT and other related fields with titles ranging from Developer Team Lead to Executives. Examples of personas/titles include: Director/VP of Engineering, Director / VP of Machine Learning (or AI), Director/VP of Enterprise Architecture, Director/VP of Product Development/Engineering, VP of Digital Transformation, Director of Applications, Director of Security (Information Security, IT Security, Application Security), VP of Operations. Phases for SimplyDirect Phase 1: Sales and Marketing create the survey and share the target accounts and personas with SimplyDirect. Upon completion, SimplyDirect sends out the survey and shares survey results with the GitLab team via the SimplyDirect portal. The account list shared with SimplyDirect has an SDR assigned to each account so the tool will send the assigned SDR an email notifying them when a survey is completed. FMM will share the portal website, username, and password in the issue for SDRs or SAEs to access survey results and analytics. FMM will also provide SDRs with training before launch on how to navigate the portal and share SimplyDirect’s best practices. This phase is considered complete once the predetermined number of survey responses is achieved (number of responses will be identified in the SOW). Please note that a gift is sent to survey respondents by SimplyDirect as a thank you for completing the survey (Example: Columbia Jacket/Fleece). SimplyDirect also creates a detailed Pulse Report with survey results when the phase is completed and provides it to GitLab along with a list of high-intent targets who did not complete the survey (see Phase 3 details on how to utilize these additional targets). Access to the portal is not indefinite so a report should be pulled from the SimplyDirect portal in order to add survey responses to our own tracking sheet if needed. Phase 2: Leads are uploaded to SFDC automatically through our SimplyDirect<>Marketo integration and SDRs can set up an Outreach sequence to follow-up with these leads by sharing the Pulse Report. There is also an option of a swag giveaway at this phase if a meeting is booked/attended. Phase 3: SimplyDirect gathers a list of additional high-intent targets (also contracted in the SOW) that have not opted in to be contacted by GitLab directly. In order to try to capture these additional leads, we can create a Pathfactory track that requires visitors to enter in their contact information to view the track (which includes the Pulse Report and other assets). SimplyDirect includes this Pathfactory link in their follow-up email to the additional contacts. Anyone who enters their contact information in Pathfactory can be sent a follow-up by GitLab. Reporting and Dashboards SimplyDirect defines engagement by targets filling out the survey. The SimplyDirect<>Marketo integration adds anyone who fills out the survey automatically into the Salesforce campaign.

Customer Success Segments CSM AMER CSM EMEA CSM APJ CSE Mission Statement Accelerate customer success by aligning passionate CSMs with customers to: Drive adoption aligned with business outcomes Enable customers in current and future GitLab use cases Expand ROI from GitLab What is a Customer Success Manager (CSM) at GitLab? CSMs are accountable for customer adoption, measurable outcomes, customer satisfaction, and creating true customer advocacy. We create successful customers by enabling, training, and nurturing them throughout their journey. The following areas incorporate the remit of a CSM: Customer Adoption - Ensure the customer is working towards or adopting their desired use cases to maturity. Ensure the successful onboarding of all intended users. Identify areas of adoption risk and establish mitigating plays and programs. Delivering Positive Business Outcomes - Ensure customers are meeting and exceeding their desired business outcomes so that customers can quantify and support their investment. Trusted Advisor - Establish “trusted advisor” relationships with the management and technical teams on the customer side while working seamlessly with our account team to deliver a best-in-class customer experience. Account Expansion - Lead adoption expansion beyond the customer’s desired use cases and further customer return on investment (ROI). Partner with Sales to identify expansion opportunities and ensure we realize the expansion potential of a customer account. Leading Business Reviews - Review and celebrate progress towards, or achievement of, the customer’s desired business outcomes. Address challenges with a plan for mitigation, align on upcoming and future customer business objectives. High-Level Responsibilities of a CSM Responsibility Context How We Measure DCI Roles Success Plans Mutually agreed (Customer | GitLab) adoption plans that outline desired outcomes (e.g., improve cycle time), technical milestones required (e.g., migrate to GitLab, overcome constraints), timelines and DRIs. These plans enable us to be proactive and ensure progress towards the customer's goals. As trusted advisors, we understand what drives value for our customers and help them achieve it. Every customer must have an active success plan DRI: CSMConsulted: AE, SA, CustomerInformed: Leadership Onboarding There are several onboarding steps in both the new and existing customer onboarding playbooks.

Communication In line with GitLab’s overall communication guidelines, campaign managers work through MRs first and issues second (in order to preserve documentation), and our slack channel #marketing-campaigns is used for team updated and quick questions. The #marketing_integratedmarketing channel is used for weekly check-ins and interaction with the larger integrated marketing team. In between bi-weekly Campaigns Team Connect calls: Updates should be added to MRs when possible Add to #marketing_programs Slack Begin with UPDATE: <brief description> (i.e. UPDATE: Marketo segmentation live for sales segment) Include link to MR (preferred) or issue Topics that need input should be added as an MR when possible, with issues as a secondary option, and pinged in Slack with DISCUSS Add to #marketing_programs Slack Begin with DISCUSS: <brief description> (i.e. DISCUSS: Marketing tool champions) Include link to MR (preferred) or issue Out of office team coverage Whenever team members are out of the office for more than 7 business days, they are required to create an ooo coverage issue outlining the coverage needed and assign that to their team counterpart providing coverage. The same process and issue template can optionally be used when team members are out of the office for less than 7 days but requires coverage for time sensitive project(s). Half-yearly Field Marketing & Campaigns Planning Workshop Every 6 months, Regional campaigns managers will conduct a joint planning workshop with their Sr Manager/Manager, Field marketing counterparts (below): Region Campaign Manager Sr Manager/Manager, Field Marketing AMER Meilynda Herbst Ginny Reib EMEA Indre Kryzeviciene Kristine Setchin APAC Timothy Tran Kate Baker Collaboration Timeline/Deliverables X week before planning session: Manager/Sr Manager of field marketing shares next quarter planned field marketing events with regional campaign managers. By planning session: Regional campaign manager to pull invite list for each planned event. During planning session: Manager/Sr Manager of field marketing & campaign manager reviews invite list. If invite list for a particular planned event is too small, collectively decide if FMM should change the event venue or work with their regional campaign manager on a strategy to grow the invite list via paid or organic channels. Meeting Cadence Most of our team meetings are recorded and can be found here. Bi-weekly - Campaigns Team Connect Call (every other is AMER/EMEA and EMEA/APAC) Monthly - Marketing All-Hands (all marketing) The Handbook Is our single source of truth (SSoT) for processes and relevant links Individual teams should link back to these SSoT sections to avoid confusion Collaborative tactics contain their own handbook pages The handbook will be iterated on as we establish and optimize processes for optimal efficiency Project Management Prioritization Campaigns Team - Prioritization At start of milestone, ensure that issues are in the proper category of prioritization. Align them to the priority definitions. Consider the time you have available in a 2 week period, recognizing meeting commitments and planned PTO. Only add issues to account for 70% of your available work hours. Don’t max out at 100% since there will likely be things that arise and need immediate attention throughout milestone. Ask yourself: considering realistic time this milestone, am I overcommitting? The first to drop from a milestone should be “Low” priority issues based on definitions. Discuss milestone with Agnes and if need help determining what to drop and how to communicate (potentially) to issue requestors. Campaigns Team - Current Milestone Minimize the “Low” and “Medium” columns. Your focus should first be on the “Top” and “High” priority issues. Prioritize completion of “Top” priority issues, then “High” priority issues. Labels Prioritization labels DG-Priority::Top: Immediate action needed, aligned to OKRs, GTM motions/sales plays, or segment/region MQL generation. This category will be limited because not everything can be a priority. Timeframe: Immediate action needed. DG-Priority::High: Not requiring immediate action, but aligned to OKRs, GTM motions/sales plays, or segment/region MQL generation. Timeframe: Within weeks. DG-Priority::Med: Requests submitted that align to OKRs, GTM motions/sales plays, or segment/region plans. Process improvements to fix broken processes, or improve campaign team efficiency. Timeframe: Within months. DG-Priority::Low: Requests submitted that would be helpful, but can be pushed for higher priority issues. Nice-to-have improvements for campaign team processes. Timeframe: No specific timeline. DG-Priority::ToBePrioritized: Requests that have not yet been prioritized by Demand Gen. Team labels mktg-demandgen: DRI is in Demand Gen team dg-campaigns: DRI is in Campaigns team dg-request: Issue requesting Demand Gen support (did not originate from DRI team) Status labels mktg-status::wip: the issue is assigned and moved into appropriate time-based milestone mktg-status::review: the work (or build) has been done, and is ready for Quality Assurance (QA) Review mktg-status::scheduled: issues related to Marketo (email, landing page, form, automation) have been scheduled and are ready to deploy mktg-status::complete: work (or build) is complete and the issue can be closed mktg-status::blocked: there were insufficient details in the issue for work to be completed mktg-status::plan: this is used for work that is in an earlier stage of planning and a specific request has not been made (backlog issues) This will likely be used mainly by campaign managers on issues that are not high priority but there is a desire to capture the idea/notes.

These templates more clearly indicate what information and details are required in order for the request to be triaged. Note on timelines: The Campaigns Team is focused on campaign strategy, execution, and optimization. Team member milestones focus on work to drive MQLs and SAOs, and requests will be committed to as bandwidth permits at discretion of Campaign Team Manager. request-email-followup - these will triage to Verticurl request-email-invitation - these will triage to Verticurl request-email-newsletter - these will triage to Verticurl request-email-reminder - these will triage to Verticurl request-email - only for general email requests these will triage to Verticurl. For customer communications, please work with Marketing Ops. request-mkto-landing-page - should mainly be used for pre-set processes where epic code includes need for landing page. request-pathfactory-track - creation of pathfactory tracks for one-time use is responsibility of owner. If used for demand generation prescriptive buyer journey, it will be triaged. request-pathfactory-upload - the content owner is responsible for uploading to Pathfactory. request-pathfactory-upload-bulk - issue to discuss more efficient process with MOps request-resource-page-addition - issue to discuss leveraging pathfactory for the resources page) request-sales-nominated - process should be used sparingly request-zoom-license-date - please use this issue template with Field Marketing (owner of Zoom) request-webcast-dryrun-sched idea-campaign idea-webcast Fundamental principles of issue requests The following issue templates are used by the campaigns team to organize their work, with appropriate labels applied for project management. /assign @ - issues should have only DRI based on who will complete the work in the issue. If work needs to be completed by multiple people, consider breaking into separate issues with clear deliverables and due dates. (example: /assign @jgragnola) /due 2021- - add due date based on workback schedules (example: /due 2020-07-13 or /due tomorrow or /due 07/13/2020) /milestone % - add milestone based on the due date of the issue (example: /milestone %\"Mktg: ) /weight - add weight between 1-5, with 1 being easiest (between 1-4 hours of time) and 5 being most complex (a full week of work). The majority of issues should fall into 1-2. If estimation is weight of 3+, break into separate issues for more manageable pieces to fit into milestones. (example: /weight 1) /epic - add epic of the overarching campaign or project to keep things organized. In almost all cases, there is a larger initiative that the issue relates to, so it is best practice to associate issues to the most relevant epic for visibility. (example: /epic [https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/-/epics/370](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/-/epics/370)) Intake process daily/weekly steps (RETIRED) Team manager completes daily review of issues in triage assessing the following standards: Are all details in the Submitter Checklist sufficiently complete in order to begin work? if yes, check that due date is at least 5 business days from date submitter details provided, move to mktg-status::wip, assign based on triage diagram, and put in current milestone (to be adjusted as needed by assignee) if no, comment to requester and move to mktg-status::blocked Does the request align to FY21-22 segment marketing plan? if no, consider realistic timeline given priorities (and share with requester in comments, set up time to discuss if needed) Shortcut issue comments for project management (RETIRED) When a team member is picking up an issue from the backlog: /label ~\"mktg-status::wip\" /assign @ /milestone %Mktg:2021- This will change the status to wip (work in progress), allow quick assignment and add to the appropriate milestone. Milestones The campaigns team uses the overall 2-week marketing milestones (format of Mktg: YYYY-MM-DD) to organize, prioritize, and balance campaigns, projects, and requests. The date in the milestone name is the END date of miltesone (Sunday) Note: Use of milestones was introduced to the campaigns team as of 2020-07-21. If issues in a milestone are not closed out by end of milestone, they are pulled to the next milestone. We will document total issues and total weight moved, to understand relative commitment levels and avoid overcommitment as we begin using milestones. FY24 Marketing Milestones To be added Campaigns Team Backlog Milestones: DG-OKRs - holds issues that are KRs in OKR initiatives DG-Backlog:Requests - holds issue requests to be triaged, typically related to Marketo (landing pages, emails, etc.) DG-Backlog:Ideas - holds issue requests related to campaign and webcast ideas submitted to demand generation DG-Backlog:Documentation - holds issues related to needed documentation (handbook, issues, etc.) DG-Backlog:General - holds general issue backlog that don’t fit into request, ideas, or documentation/process Boards and Lists Boards Campaigns Team Current Milestone - this board provides a high-level status view of issues in the current milestone by team member.

If a team member feels uncomfortable or unsafe traveling to a location on GitLab’s behalf due to concerns about the location, region, personal health, or other safety or security risks, please contact the People Operations team via HelpLab or email. The People Operations team will assist by helping to connect the team member with the right resources. Please note that team member travel is not required unless deemed essential to the role. Please speak to your manager about whether the travel is mandatory and required for your role. Trade Compliance Considerations Although GitLab is an all-remote company that encourages working from anywhere, some places are subject to trade control restrictions. For this reason, team members cannot take company-owned devices to or otherwise work from US-embargoed countries or regions under any circumstances. US-embargoed countries currently include Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and Syria and US-embargoed regions include the Crimea, Donetsk, and Luhansk regions of Ukraine; however, that list is subject to change without notice. Additionally, team members cannot take company-owned devices to or otherwise work from Russia or Belarus, which are also subject to various restrictions. Information Security Considerations Please refer to the Internal Handbook for Information Security Considerations for GitLab Team members traveling abroad.

If you feel that your travel frequency may expose your data please keep in mind the following points to ensure that sensitive data contained in your devices will not be compromised: VPN - If you are connecting from an untrusted network you should use a VPN connection to avoid MITM Attack or similar. Devices in public places - If you are using your device in a public place someone could read restricted data from your screen, you should protect your screen with a special film that ensure your privacy, here you can find some samples. Speaking in crowded places - Ensure that when you are talking about restricted data you are in a secure place and no-one can hear you. 1Password travel mode - If you are approaching travel in a risky country or you have to leave your devices in an insecure place, please use Travel Mode in 1Password to ensure that your vaults will be safe if your device is compromised. When traveling, there is the possibility that customs, border control, or other law enforcement agents demand that you provide the password to your laptop or mobile device. If this happens to you in regards to a company-owned account or device, GitLab recommends that you comply with any such requests without protesting. If you do end up providing a password to any device or account that has access to GitLab resources (including your personal devices), you should follow the process to engage Security on-call as soon as you can safely do so. Even if you do not provide a password, if any of your devices are permanently seized or even temporarily removed from sight, you should also engage the Security on-call. For additional security specifically when traveling through an airport, the following advice is provided: Completely power-off laptops and mobile devices before any security checkpoints. This reduces the risk of attacks that may be conducted against machines in a sleep mode, where the disk encryption is not being actively enforced. Prior to the trip, remove any sensitive data from your local machine that is not absolutely required. Refer to the Data Classification Standards for more information.

GitLab has recently surpassed the $150M ARR milestone, with unusually high revenue growth and retention rates. GitLab is uniquely positioned in the market with a vision to offer a single application for the entire DevSecOps lifecycle. GitLab competes across numerous market segments and aims to deliver value in 80+ market categories. GitLab’s product vision is uniquely ambitious, as we were the first DevSecOps player to take a single application approach. From idea to production, GitLab helps teams improve cycle time from weeks to minutes, reduce development process costs, and enable a faster time to market while increasing developer productivity. With software “eating the world,” this is widely viewed as a mission-critical value proposition for customers. We also have a number of tailwinds in the form of cloud adoption, Kubernetes adoption, and DevSecOps tool consolidation, which are helping fuel our rapid growth. Finally, GitLab has an open source community and distribution model, which has exposed the value of GitLab to millions of developers and has sped up the maturation of our product through more than 200 monthly improvements to the GitLab codebase from our users. Strategic challenges Tension between Breadth and Depth: Our ambitious single-application product vision means we need to build out feature function value across a very large surface area. With so much to deliver in a single application, it is a big UX challenge to keep the experience simple, consistent, and seamless between DevSecOps phases. Our challenge is to drive the right balance between breadth and depth by retaining a seed then nurture approach in new product areas while simultaneously improving existing product areas that generate usage and revenue. Shifting more focus to product depth will allow us to win and retain sophisticated enterprise customers. GitLab.com and Self-Managed: Another challenge we face is the balance between our self-managed and GitLab.com offerings. GitLab's early paying customers were more interested in self-managed, and the majority of our customers use this offering today. As a result, we focused heavily on delivering a great self-managed customer experience. However, as the market shifts toward cloud adoption, we are seeing an increasing demand for our GitLab.com offering. We now need to rapidly meet the same enterprise-grade security, reliability, and performance expectations our paying customers have come to expect from self-managed in our SaaS (.com offering). Wide Customer Profile: We also serve a wide range of customers, from individual contributor developers to large enterprises, across all vertical markets. This range of deployment options and customer sizes makes our business complex and makes it hard to optimize the customer experience for all customer sizes. Over the past few years, we have prioritized enabling our direct sales channel, but in the process have not focused enough on great customer experiences around self-service purchase workflows, onboarding, and cross-stage adoption. Competition: Finally, we have formidable competition from much larger companies, including Microsoft, Atlassian, and Synopsys to name a few. Microsoft is starting to mimic our single application positioning, and while behind us in the journey, have substantial resources to dedicate to competing with GitLab. Product Strategy Focus on increasing Stages per Organization (SpO): There is a strong correlation between the number of stages customers use and their propensity to upgrade to a paid package. In fact, adding a stage triples conversion! Each product group should be laser-focused on driving adoption and regular usage of their respective stages, as it should lead to higher Net ARR, reduced churn, and higher customer satisfaction. As outlined in this user journey, the most important additional stages for customers to adopt are Create to Verify and Verify to Release, as each of these adoption steps open up three additional stages to users. Harness the unique power of a single application: GitLab’s primary point of differentiation is our single application approach. As we continue to drive value in any given stage or category, our first instinct should be to connect that feature or product experience to other parts of the GitLab product. These cross-stage connections will drive differentiated customer value and will be impossible for point product competitors to imitate. Recognizing this opportunity, we have grown our R&D organization significantly over the past two years, and plan to invest an outsized amount on R&D for the next 2-3 years to extend our lead in executing against the single application product vision. Increase wider-community contributions: To achieve this ambitious vision more quickly, we will leverage our powerful open source community. Each stage should have a clear strategy for tiering the value of the stage. When stages are early in maturity, we will bias toward including as much functionality in our Core open source version as possible, to drive more rapid adoption and greater community contributions, which will",

When stages are early in maturity, we will bias toward including as much functionality in our Core open source version as possible, to drive more rapid adoption and greater community contributions, which will help us mature new stages faster. Once stage adoption is achieved, we can then layer on additional value in paid tiers to encourage upgrades. Make our core journey categories complete: We want to ensure the core product usage experience is great, which will lead to more paying customers and improved customer retention. We intend to maintain our market-leading depth in stages with complete categories, which currently are Verify (Continuous Integration) and Create (Source Code Management and Code Review). Beyond that, we will endeavor to rapidly mature our offering to complete in Plan (3rd most used stage), Release (4th most used stage), and Secure (important element of our Ultimate tier). GitLab-hosted first: Most customers don't want to run GitLab themselves (self-managed), so we should build out the offerings where we do it for them (GitLab-hosted). GitLab-hosted includes our SaaS (GitLab.com), any single-tenant offerings, and other GitLab hosted services that self-managed installations can use. Our customer and revenue growth rate for our SaaS offering is faster than our self-managed offering. To meet growing customer demand, our SaaS offering needs to have enterprise-grade security, availability, and performance. We must also ensure feature parity between self-managed and SaaS and that customers have an easy migration path from self-managed to SaaS. Going forward, all new features should be available on SaaS when they are available on self-managed, if not before. We will also begin offering GitLab-hosted services to self-managed customers to provide additional value that may not be feasible to deliver in a self-managed environment, e.g. automated cloud backups. Finally, we expect to offer different GitLab-hosted deployment options for single tenant customers and specific geographic regions to meet the regulatory, security, and data residency requirements of various customer segments. Fiscal year product investment themes Every year at GitLab, we choose some specific areas of emphasis to help guide the teams on the areas of our product that we want to accentuate. This section is used to highlight that emphasis. It is not a comprehensive list of everything we plan to do this year. Direction for each stage and category can be found at the respective direction pages. We are not asking the teams to deviate from their core mission. Many teams will see themselves contributing to these areas of emphasis directly. The other teams will continue to execute on their mission - that is also important. The themes are to help facilitate cross-team collaboration when invariably teams working on the 1-year themes may need to collaborate with others. Our guidance is: if any team approaches you to prioritize something that is thematic for this year, consider that as a higher priority than you would normally - as it is in service of the broader product-wide goal that we, as a company, have deemed important to accomplish this year. See Product Investment (internal handbook page) for how we allocate our R&D investment across our product hierarchy. FY26 Key Principles Driving Themes Usability: Users are telling us that we need to better meet their expectations and make the experience more intuitive. Depth: We need to stop doing some of the things we are doing today. Customers are asking us to improve core functionality through usability improvements and remove half-completed features. Data Quality: Without more visibility, we cannot make as many data-driven decisions. And neither can our customers. We need to complete our data unification effort to make this easier. Deployment Parity: All three deployments (GitLab.com, GitLab Dedicated, Self-Managed) will have feature parity (with the exception of “admin area” topics on .com and Dedicated). R&D Investment Themes For FY26, the four key R&D investment themes we are focused on are: Win with DevSecOps platform completeness Differentiate with AI across the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Lead with SDLC insights and reporting Elevate customer-centricity to customer obsession Win with DevSecOps platform completeness We will focus primarily on core DevSecOps platform capabilities across SCM, CI, CD, security, compliance, and enterprise agile planning with the goal to achieve a leadership position or extend our existing leadership position. We will drive Premium and Ultimate value by helping propel free-to-paid conversion through product-led growth / feature discovery moments. Differentiate with AI across the SDLC We will introduce new as well as improve existing GitLab Duo AI capabilities within our core DevSecOps platform capabilities. We will also bring ModelOps features to general availability, including a focus on enabling customers to work with native data science workloads within GitLab. Lead with SDLC insights and reporting We will focus on deepening the types, and quality of metrics, as well as pulling metrics from third party integrations, with the goal of making GitLab the central component to understanding SDLC insights. We will also provide reporting of feature usage enabling customers to understand what features and capabilities are being used by their teams as well as what usage",

We will also provide reporting of feature usage enabling customers to understand what features and capabilities are being used by their teams as well as what usage is connected to Premium and Ultimate tiers, or are features and capabilities included in add-ons. Elevate customer-centricity to customer obsession We will focus on addressing use case adoption issues as well as improving user experience within onboarding to improve our customer's time-to-value for core DevSecOps platform capabilities. We will improve customer experience improve ease-of-use for SMB/commercial customers with license management and self-service workflows. Based upon and informed by the pricing research completed in FY25, we will also implement an updated pricing strategy. FY25 Key Principles Driving Themes Depth over Breadth: For the past several years we have focused on breadth over depth. This has allowed us to show our direction as a company and define the DevOps Platform market. In FY24, we pivoted to depth over breadth as product depth allows us to win and retain sophisticated enterprise customers. We will continue our focus on depth throughout FY25. Drive Adoption of Ultimate: Due to the increasing demands for security and compliance in software development, GitLab Ultimate continues to gain popularity with our customers. We will focus on increasing the value of Ultimate by not only improving security and compliance functionality but also adding value from other key areas within our platform like Plan, Verify, and Data Science. Differentiate: Our primary point of differentiation is our single application approach: all aspects of our DevSecOps platform work seamlessly together, right out of the box, and can be tailored to the specific needs of each organization. R&D Investment Themes For FY25, the four key R&D investment themes we are focused on are: Enable AI/ML Efficiencies Across DevSecOps Drive Use Case Adoption to Fully Realize Value Differentiate on DevSecOps Platform Strengthen Our SaaS Deployments & Capabilities Enable AI/ML Efficiencies Across DevSecOps AI as part of software development has continued to mature and has become the number one topic in our customer discussions. To meet our customers’ needs and the evolving market landscape, we will take a three pronged approach to AI (GitLab Duo, ModelOps, AI agents) as part of our DevSecOps platform providing us differentiation in the market. Drive Use Case Adoption to Fully Realize Value CI and CD are critical to the success of Premium, while security and governance drives value in Ultimate. We will increase our focus on adoption of these areas - ensuring that customers realize the value of the capabilities they have paid for. This will continue to reduce churn, drive free-to-paid conversion, and increase up-tiering from Premium to Ultimate. Differentiate on DevSecOps Platform Toolchain consolidation continues to come up with customers as well as in our annual DevSecOps survey. We will capitalize on our position as the enterprise DevSecOps platform by continuing to expand our planning capabilities, continuing to mature our metrics and reporting, and bring new SCM capabilities to general availability. Strengthen Our SaaS Deployments & Capabilities GitLab.com and GitLab Dedicated continue to grow in popularity as more organizations need to undergo digital transformations however do not want the overhead of self-hosting their DevSecOps platform. We expect this trend to continue in FY25 and will invest in our SaaS deployments to ensure they meet our customers’ expectations. DevSecOps stages DevSecOpsPlanCodeBuildTestReleaseDeployOperateMonitorSecurityCompliance DevSecOps is a broad space with a lot of complexity. To manage this within GitLab, we break down the DevSecOps lifecycle into a few different sections, each with its own direction page you can review. Dev Section Direction - Includes the Plan and Create stages CI Section Direction - Includes the Verify and Package stages CD Section Direction - Includes the Deploy stage, which includes the Environments group Sec Section Direction - Includes the Software Supply Chain Security Direction and the Application Security Testing, Software Supply Chain Security, and Security Risk Management stages Data Science Section Direction - Includes the ModelOps stage, which includes the MLOps and DataOps groups AI Section Direction - Includes the AI-powered stage, which includes the AI Framework, Duo Chat, Agent Foundations, Code Creation, Custom Models, Editor Extensions, Global Search, and Workflow Catalog groups Analytics Section Direction - Includes the Analytics stage, which includes the Analytics Instrumentation, Platform Insights, and Optimize groups Growth Section Direction - Includes the Growth stage, which includes the Engagement, Acquisition, and Activation groups Fulfillment Section Direction - Includes the Fulfillment stage, which includes the Provision, Utilization, Fulfillment Platform, Subscription Management, and Seat Management groups Foundations Section Direction - Includes the Foundations stage, which includes the Design System, UX Paper Cuts, and Accessibility groups Tenant Scale Section Direction - Includes the Data Access and Runtime stages GitLab Delivery Section Direction - Includes the GitLab Delivery stage, which includes the GitLab Build, Operate, and Release and Deploy groups Production Engineering Section Direction - Includes the Production Engineering stage, which includes the Runway, Networking and Incident Management, Observability, and Runners Platform groups GitLab Dedicated Section Direction - Includes the GitLab Dedicated stage,",

These community contributions are an important part our company mission and strategy. Our issue tracker contains requests made for features and changes to GitLab. Contributing is the best way to get a feature you want included as we continually merge code to be released in the next version. Please see our Contribute to GitLab page for more details such as guides to get started contributing, areas looking for contributions, and contribution acceptance criteria. Personas Personas are the people we design for. Developers, security professionals, and operations professionals are currently the primary personas we focus on, and we tailor our user experience to their needs. We want GitLab to be the main interface for people in these roles, so they can show up at work, start their day, and load up GitLab. And that’s already happening. But there are a lot of other roles involved with the development and delivery of software. That is the ultimate GitLab goal - where everyone involved with software development and delivery uses a single application so they are on the same page with the rest of their team. We are rapidly expanding our user experience for Designers, Compliance Managers, Product Managers, and Release Managers. We’ll also be expanding to the business side, with Executive visibility and reporting. While we’re still calling it DevSecOps, we’re really expanding the definition of DevSecOps and delivering it all as a single application. Mitigating low-end disruption GitLab is not immune to disruption. In some ways, it is a sign of success that GitLab is now at a scale where we have to think about low-end disruption. Arguably, a few years ago, GitLab was a low-end disruptor. Clayton Christensen defines low-end-disruption as follows: Low-end disruption refers to businesses that come in at the bottom of the market and serve customers in a way that is \"good enough.\" These are generally the lower profit markets for the incumbent and thus, when these new businesses enter, the incumbents move further \"upstream.\" In other words, they put their focus on where the greater profit margins are. Our perspective is that low-end disruption is an additional and critical sensing mechanism. This is especially true for the DevSecOps market. We look at the following attributes to figure out if a low-end disruption has anything close to potential product-market resonance. This list is an adaptation of the Product Zeitgeist Fit. Builder Enthusiasm: Are the most talented, hardest working, or most-in-demand people - the engineers, the developers - so intrigued by the approach that they are working on it, excited by it, and trying to make it a thing? If that is the case, then there is a good chance that they will eventually make it happen, moving beyond the fringes to the mainstream. Number of stars, forks, and contributions in the repo are some metrics to look for here. Despite Test: When people are using a product despite the fact that it’s not the best thing out there, or, in some cases, that it’s straight-up terrible, it’s a great sign. It shows that the product has a line into something emotional, not solely functional. Wanted, not just needed. In the early days, these products can often feel misunderstood or controversial. At first blush, the conceit may even raise a few eyebrows. But to the people who have been working on those products, they’re so clearly elegant, if temporarily imperfect, solutions to big and important problems that they seem almost obvious once they recognize it. Google Trends and posts on Hacker News are some things to monitor here. T-shirt Test: If people with no connection to the company are wearing their t-shirts or putting their stickers on their laptops or wearing their socks, that desire to associate with the idea indicates as much a movement as a product. A reason low-end disruptors are able to enter the market is that the feature-absorption by users is lower than the feature-velocity of the established vendor. To address this we are focused on a working-by-default configuration principle. Maturity As we add new categories and stages to GitLab, some areas of the product will be deeper and more mature than others. We publish a list of the categories, what we think their maturity levels are, and our plans to improve on our categories page. We strive to be the best product in the market and to be complete. As the market, customer",

    "content": "misunderstood or controversial. At first blush, the conceit may even raise a few eyebrows. But to the people who have been working on those products, they’re so clearly elegant, if temporarily imperfect, solutions to big and important problems that they seem almost obvious once they recognize it. Google Trends and posts on Hacker News are some things to monitor here. T-shirt Test: If people with no connection to the company are wearing their t-shirts or putting their stickers on their laptops or wearing their socks, that desire to associate with the idea indicates as much a movement as a product. A reason low-end disruptors are able to enter the market is that the feature-absorption by users is lower than the feature-velocity of the established vendor. To address this we are focused on a working-by-default configuration principle. Maturity As we add new categories and stages to GitLab, some areas of the product will be deeper and more mature than others. We publish a list of the categories, what we think their maturity levels are, and our plans to improve on our categories page. We strive to be the best product in the market and to be complete. As the market, customer needs, competitive landscape, and technology change, we should expect our maturities to also change, including changing to a lower maturity rating. By embracing a focus on improvement and low level of shame, we encourage moving a maturity down. This is a strong indicator that we are realists about our product with an eye on achieving the best results for our customers. Scope We try to prevent maintaining functionality that is language or platform specific, because they slow down our ability to get results. Examples of how we handle it instead are: We don't make native mobile clients. Instead, we make sure our mobile web pages are great. We don't make native clients for desktop operating systems. We make our web application great—for example, GitLab was the first to have merge conflict resolution in our web application. People can also use Tower or other clients. For language translations, we rely on the wider community. For code navigation, we're hesitant to introduce navigation improvements that only work for a subset of languages. For building and testing with Auto DevOps, we use Heroku Buildpacks. Outside our scope are Kubernetes and everything it depends on: Network (fabric) Flannel, Openflow, VMware NSX, Cisco ACI Proxy (layer 7) Envoy, nginx, HAProxy, traefik Ingress (north/south) Contour, Ambassador, Service mesh (east/west) Istio, Linkerd Container Scheduler we mainly focus on Kubernetes, other container schedulers are: CloudFoundry, OpenStack, OpenShift, Mesos DCOS, Docker Swarm, Atlas/Terraform, Nomad, Deis, Convox, Flynn, Tutum, GiantSwarm, Rancher Package manager Helm, ksonnet Operating System Ubuntu, CentOS, RHEL, CoreOS, Alpine Linux During a presentation of Kubernetes, Brendan Burns talks about the four Ops layers at the 2:00 mark: Application Ops Cluster Ops Kernel/OS Ops Hardware Ops GitLab helps you mainly with application ops. And where needed, we also allow you to monitor clusters and link them to application environments. But we intend to use vanilla Kubernetes, instead of something specific to GitLab. Also outside our scope are products that are not specific to developing, securing, or operating applications and digital products. Identity management: Okta and Duo, you use this mainly with SaaS applications you don't develop, secure, or operate. SaaS integration: Zapier and IFTTT Ecommerce: Shopify In scope are things that are not mainly for SaaS applications: Network security, since it overlaps with application security to some extent. Security information and event management (SIEM), since that measures applications and network. Office productivity applications, since \"We believe that all digital products should be open to contributions, from legal documents to movie scripts and from websites to chip designs\" We expect GitLab to continue to grow, and we have several ideas for possible future stages Quarterly Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) To make sure our goals are clearly defined and aligned throughout the organization, we make use of OKRs (Objectives and Key Results). Our quarterly Objectives and Key Results are publicly viewable. How we plan releases At GitLab, we strive to be ambitious, maintain a strong sense of urgency, and set aspirational targets with every release. The direction items we highlight in our kickoff are a reflection of this ambitious planning. When it comes to execution, we aim for velocity over predictability. This way, we optimize our planning time to focus on the top of the queue and deliver things fast. We schedule 100% of what we can accomplish based on past Development Department merge request rate and availability factors (vacation, contribute, etc.). See our product handbook on how we prioritize. Previous releases On our releases page, you can find an overview of the most important features of recent releases and links to the blog posts for each release. Upcoming releases GitLab releases a new version every single month. You can find the major planned features for upcoming releases on our upcoming releases page or see the upcoming features for paid tiers. Note that we often move things around, do things that are not listed, and cancel things that are listed. ML/AI at GitLab With Gitlab 15.4, Suggested Reviewers was released as our first customer-facing ML/AI technology in production features. We have additional ambitions in the near future for several types of problems. This is the focus of our new ModelOps stage. Cross-Stage efforts GitLab consistently strives to deliver a cohesive experience that enables workflows that span the DevSecOps loop. We have a number of existing capabilities and planned improvements that do just that: TBA Footnotes IDC, Worldwide DevOps Software Tools Forecast, 2020–2024, Doc # US45188520, July 2020 Edit this page View source",

GitLab has recently surpassed the $150M ARR milestone, with unusually high revenue growth and retention rates. GitLab is uniquely positioned in the market with a vision to offer a single application for the entire DevSecOps lifecycle. GitLab competes across numerous market segments and aims to deliver value in 80+ market categories. GitLab’s product vision is uniquely ambitious, as we were the first DevSecOps player to take a single application approach. From idea to production, GitLab helps teams improve cycle time from weeks to minutes, reduce development process costs, and enable a faster time to market while increasing developer productivity. With software “eating the world,” this is widely viewed as a mission-critical value proposition for customers. We also have a number of tailwinds in the form of cloud adoption, Kubernetes adoption, and DevSecOps tool consolidation, which are helping fuel our rapid growth. Finally, GitLab has an open source community and distribution model, which has exposed the value of GitLab to millions of developers and has sped up the maturation of our product through more than 200 monthly improvements to the GitLab codebase from our users. Strategic challenges Tension between Breadth and Depth: Our ambitious single-application product vision means we need to build out feature function value across a very large surface area. With so much to deliver in a single application, it is a big UX challenge to keep the experience simple, consistent, and seamless between DevSecOps phases. Our challenge is to drive the right balance between breadth and depth by retaining a seed then nurture approach in new product areas while simultaneously improving existing product areas that generate usage and revenue. Shifting more focus to product depth will allow us to win and retain sophisticated enterprise customers. GitLab.com and Self-Managed: Another challenge we face is the balance between our self-managed and GitLab.com offerings. GitLab's early paying customers were more interested in self-managed, and the majority of our customers use this offering today. As a result, we focused heavily on delivering a great self-managed customer experience. However, as the market shifts toward cloud adoption, we are seeing an increasing demand for our GitLab.com offering. We now need to rapidly meet the same enterprise-grade security, reliability, and performance expectations our paying customers have come to expect from self-managed in our SaaS (.com offering). Wide Customer Profile: We also serve a wide range of customers, from individual contributor developers to large enterprises, across all vertical markets. This range of deployment options and customer sizes makes our business complex and makes it hard to optimize the customer experience for all customer sizes. Over the past few years, we have prioritized enabling our direct sales channel, but in the process have not focused enough on great customer experiences around self-service purchase workflows, onboarding, and cross-stage adoption. Competition: Finally, we have formidable competition from much larger companies, including Microsoft, Atlassian, and Synopsys to name a few. Microsoft is starting to mimic our single application positioning, and while behind us in the journey, have substantial resources to dedicate to competing with GitLab. Product Strategy Focus on increasing Stages per Organization (SpO): There is a strong correlation between the number of stages customers use and their propensity to upgrade to a paid package. In fact, adding a stage triples conversion! Each product group should be laser-focused on driving adoption and regular usage of their respective stages, as it should lead to higher Net ARR, reduced churn, and higher customer satisfaction. As outlined in this user journey, the most important additional stages for customers to adopt are Create to Verify and Verify to Release, as each of these adoption steps open up three additional stages to users. Harness the unique power of a single application: GitLab’s primary point of differentiation is our single application approach. As we continue to drive value in any given stage or category, our first instinct should be to connect that feature or product experience to other parts of the GitLab product. These cross-stage connections will drive differentiated customer value and will be impossible for point product competitors to imitate. Recognizing this opportunity, we have grown our R&D organization significantly over the past two years, and plan to invest an outsized amount on R&D for the next 2-3 years to extend our lead in executing against the single application product vision. Increase wider-community contributions: To achieve this ambitious vision more quickly, we will leverage our powerful open source community. Each stage should have a clear strategy for tiering the value of the stage. When stages are early in maturity, we will bias toward including as much functionality in our Core open source version as possible, to drive more rapid adoption and greater community contributions, which will",

These cross-stage connections will drive differentiated customer value and will be impossible for point product competitors to imitate. Recognizing this opportunity, we have grown our R&D organization significantly over the past two years, and plan to invest an outsized amount on R&D for the next 2-3 years to extend our lead in executing against the single application product vision. Increase wider-community contributions: To achieve this ambitious vision more quickly, we will leverage our powerful open source community. Each stage should have a clear strategy for tiering the value of the stage. When stages are early in maturity, we will bias toward including as much functionality in our Core open source version as possible, to drive more rapid adoption and greater community contributions, which will help us mature new stages faster. Once stage adoption is achieved, we can then layer on additional value in paid tiers to encourage upgrades. Make our core journey categories complete: We want to ensure the core product usage experience is great, which will lead to more paying customers and improved customer retention. We intend to maintain our market-leading depth in stages with complete categories, which currently are Verify (Continuous Integration) and Create (Source Code Management and Code Review). Beyond that, we will endeavor to rapidly mature our offering to complete in Plan (3rd most used stage), Release (4th most used stage), and Secure (important element of our Ultimate tier). GitLab-hosted first: Most customers don't want to run GitLab themselves (self-managed), so we should build out the offerings where we do it for them (GitLab-hosted). GitLab-hosted includes our SaaS (GitLab.com), any single-tenant offerings, and other GitLab hosted services that self-managed installations can use. Our customer and revenue growth rate for our SaaS offering is faster than our self-managed offering. To meet growing customer demand, our SaaS offering needs to have enterprise-grade security, availability, and performance. We must also ensure feature parity between self-managed and SaaS and that customers have an easy migration path from self-managed to SaaS. Going forward, all new features should be available on SaaS when they are available on self-managed, if not before. We will also begin offering GitLab-hosted services to self-managed customers to provide additional value that may not be feasible to deliver in a self-managed environment, e.g. automated cloud backups. Finally, we expect to offer different GitLab-hosted deployment options for single tenant customers and specific geographic regions to meet the regulatory, security, and data residency requirements of various customer segments. Fiscal year product investment themes Every year at GitLab, we choose some specific areas of emphasis to help guide the teams on the areas of our product that we want to accentuate. This section is used to highlight that emphasis. It is not a comprehensive list of everything we plan to do this year. Direction for each stage and category can be found at the respective direction pages. We are not asking the teams to deviate from their core mission. Many teams will see themselves contributing to these areas of emphasis directly. The other teams will continue to execute on their mission - that is also important. The themes are to help facilitate cross-team collaboration when invariably teams working on the 1-year themes may need to collaborate with others. Our guidance is: if any team approaches you to prioritize something that is thematic for this year, consider that as a higher priority than you would normally - as it is in service of the broader product-wide goal that we, as a company, have deemed important to accomplish this year. See Product Investment (internal handbook page) for how we allocate our R&D investment across our product hierarchy. FY26 Key Principles Driving Themes Usability: Users are telling us that we need to better meet their expectations and make the experience more intuitive. Depth: We need to stop doing some of the things we are doing today. Customers are asking us to improve core functionality through usability improvements and remove half-completed features. Data Quality: Without more visibility, we cannot make as many data-driven decisions. And neither can our customers. We need to complete our data unification effort to make this easier. Deployment Parity: All three deployments (GitLab.com, GitLab Dedicated, Self-Managed) will have feature parity (with the exception of “admin area” topics on .com and Dedicated). R&D Investment Themes For FY26, the four key R&D investment themes we are focused on are: Win with DevSecOps platform completeness Differentiate with AI across the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Lead with SDLC insights and reporting Elevate customer-centricity to customer obsession Win with DevSecOps platform completeness We will focus primarily on core DevSecOps platform capabilities across SCM, CI, CD, security, compliance, and enterprise agile planning with the goal to achieve a leadership position or extend our existing leadership position. We will drive Premium and Ultimate value by helping propel free-to-paid conversion through product-led growth / feature discovery moments. Differentiate with AI across the SDLC We will introduce new as well as improve existing GitLab Duo AI capabilities within our core DevSecOps platform capabilities. We will also bring ModelOps features to general availability, including a focus on enabling customers to work with native data science workloads within GitLab. Lead with SDLC insights and reporting We will focus on deepening the types, and quality of metrics, as well as pulling metrics from third party integrations, with the goal of making GitLab the central component to understanding SDLC insights. We will also provide reporting of feature usage enabling customers to understand what features and capabilities are being used by their teams as well as what usage",

We will improve customer experience improve ease-of-use for SMB/commercial customers with license management and self-service workflows. Based upon and informed by the pricing research completed in FY25, we will also implement an updated pricing strategy. FY25 Key Principles Driving Themes Depth over Breadth: For the past several years we have focused on breadth over depth. This has allowed us to show our direction as a company and define the DevOps Platform market. In FY24, we pivoted to depth over breadth as product depth allows us to win and retain sophisticated enterprise customers. We will continue our focus on depth throughout FY25. Drive Adoption of Ultimate: Due to the increasing demands for security and compliance in software development, GitLab Ultimate continues to gain popularity with our customers. We will focus on increasing the value of Ultimate by not only improving security and compliance functionality but also adding value from other key areas within our platform like Plan, Verify, and Data Science. Differentiate: Our primary point of differentiation is our single application approach: all aspects of our DevSecOps platform work seamlessly together, right out of the box, and can be tailored to the specific needs of each organization. R&D Investment Themes For FY25, the four key R&D investment themes we are focused on are: Enable AI/ML Efficiencies Across DevSecOps Drive Use Case Adoption to Fully Realize Value Differentiate on DevSecOps Platform Strengthen Our SaaS Deployments & Capabilities Enable AI/ML Efficiencies Across DevSecOps AI as part of software development has continued to mature and has become the number one topic in our customer discussions. To meet our customers’ needs and the evolving market landscape, we will take a three pronged approach to AI (GitLab Duo, ModelOps, AI agents) as part of our DevSecOps platform providing us differentiation in the market. Drive Use Case Adoption to Fully Realize Value CI and CD are critical to the success of Premium, while security and governance drives value in Ultimate. We will increase our focus on adoption of these areas - ensuring that customers realize the value of the capabilities they have paid for. This will continue to reduce churn, drive free-to-paid conversion, and increase up-tiering from Premium to Ultimate. Differentiate on DevSecOps Platform Toolchain consolidation continues to come up with customers as well as in our annual DevSecOps survey. We will capitalize on our position as the enterprise DevSecOps platform by continuing to expand our planning capabilities, continuing to mature our metrics and reporting, and bring new SCM capabilities to general availability. Strengthen Our SaaS Deployments & Capabilities GitLab.com and GitLab Dedicated continue to grow in popularity as more organizations need to undergo digital transformations however do not want the overhead of self-hosting their DevSecOps platform. We expect this trend to continue in FY25 and will invest in our SaaS deployments to ensure they meet our customers’ expectations. DevSecOps stages DevSecOpsPlanCodeBuildTestReleaseDeployOperateMonitorSecurityCompliance DevSecOps is a broad space with a lot of complexity. To manage this within GitLab, we break down the DevSecOps lifecycle into a few different sections, each with its own direction page you can review. Dev Section Direction - Includes the Plan and Create stages CI Section Direction - Includes the Verify and Package stages CD Section Direction - Includes the Deploy stage, which includes the Environments group Sec Section Direction - Includes the Software Supply Chain Security Direction and the Application Security Testing, Software Supply Chain Security, and Security Risk Management stages Data Science Section Direction - Includes the ModelOps stage, which includes the MLOps and DataOps groups AI Section Direction - Includes the AI-powered stage, which includes the AI Framework, Duo Chat, Agent Foundations, Code Creation, Custom Models, Editor Extensions, Global Search, and Workflow Catalog groups Analytics Section Direction - Includes the Analytics stage, which includes the Analytics Instrumentation, Platform Insights, and Optimize groups Growth Section Direction - Includes the Growth stage, which includes the Engagement, Acquisition, and Activation groups Fulfillment Section Direction - Includes the Fulfillment stage, which includes the Provision, Utilization, Fulfillment Platform, Subscription Management, and Seat Management groups Foundations Section Direction - Includes the Foundations stage, which includes the Design System, UX Paper Cuts, and Accessibility groups Tenant Scale Section Direction - Includes the Data Access and Runtime stages GitLab Delivery Section Direction - Includes the GitLab Delivery stage, which includes the GitLab Build, Operate, and Release and Deploy groups Production Engineering Section Direction - Includes the Production Engineering stage, which includes the Runway, Networking and Incident Management, Observability, and Runners Platform groups GitLab Dedicated Section Direction - Includes the GitLab Dedicated stage,",

These community contributions are an important part our company mission and strategy. Our issue tracker contains requests made for features and changes to GitLab. Contributing is the best way to get a feature you want included as we continually merge code to be released in the next version. Please see our Contribute to GitLab page for more details such as guides to get started contributing, areas looking for contributions, and contribution acceptance criteria. Personas Personas are the people we design for. Developers, security professionals, and operations professionals are currently the primary personas we focus on, and we tailor our user experience to their needs. We want GitLab to be the main interface for people in these roles, so they can show up at work, start their day, and load up GitLab. And that’s already happening. But there are a lot of other roles involved with the development and delivery of software. That is the ultimate GitLab goal - where everyone involved with software development and delivery uses a single application so they are on the same page with the rest of their team. We are rapidly expanding our user experience for Designers, Compliance Managers, Product Managers, and Release Managers. We’ll also be expanding to the business side, with Executive visibility and reporting. While we’re still calling it DevSecOps, we’re really expanding the definition of DevSecOps and delivering it all as a single application. Mitigating low-end disruption GitLab is not immune to disruption. In some ways, it is a sign of success that GitLab is now at a scale where we have to think about low-end disruption. Arguably, a few years ago, GitLab was a low-end disruptor. Clayton Christensen defines low-end-disruption as follows: Low-end disruption refers to businesses that come in at the bottom of the market and serve customers in a way that is \"good enough.\" These are generally the lower profit markets for the incumbent and thus, when these new businesses enter, the incumbents move further \"upstream.\" In other words, they put their focus on where the greater profit margins are. Our perspective is that low-end disruption is an additional and critical sensing mechanism. This is especially true for the DevSecOps market. We look at the following attributes to figure out if a low-end disruption has anything close to potential product-market resonance. This list is an adaptation of the Product Zeitgeist Fit. Builder Enthusiasm: Are the most talented, hardest working, or most-in-demand people - the engineers, the developers - so intrigued by the approach that they are working on it, excited by it, and trying to make it a thing? If that is the case, then there is a good chance that they will eventually make it happen, moving beyond the fringes to the mainstream. Number of stars, forks, and contributions in the repo are some metrics to look for here. Despite Test: When people are using a product despite the fact that it’s not the best thing out there, or, in some cases, that it’s straight-up terrible, it’s a great sign. It shows that the product has a line into something emotional, not solely functional. Wanted, not just needed. In the early days, these products can often feel misunderstood or controversial. At first blush, the conceit may even raise a few eyebrows. But to the people who have been working on those products, they’re so clearly elegant, if temporarily imperfect, solutions to big and important problems that they seem almost obvious once they recognize it. Google Trends and posts on Hacker News are some things to monitor here. T-shirt Test: If people with no connection to the company are wearing their t-shirts or putting their stickers on their laptops or wearing their socks, that desire to associate with the idea indicates as much a movement as a product. A reason low-end disruptors are able to enter the market is that the feature-absorption by users is lower than the feature-velocity of the established vendor. To address this we are focused on a working-by-default configuration principle. Maturity As we add new categories and stages to GitLab, some areas of the product will be deeper and more mature than others. We publish a list of the categories, what we think their maturity levels are, and our plans to improve on our categories page. We strive to be the best product in the market and to be complete.

We publish a list of the categories, what we think their maturity levels are, and our plans to improve on our categories page. We strive to be the best product in the market and to be complete. As the market, customer needs, competitive landscape, and technology change, we should expect our maturities to also change, including changing to a lower maturity rating. By embracing a focus on improvement and low level of shame, we encourage moving a maturity down. This is a strong indicator that we are realists about our product with an eye on achieving the best results for our customers. Scope We try to prevent maintaining functionality that is language or platform specific, because they slow down our ability to get results. Examples of how we handle it instead are: We don't make native mobile clients. Instead, we make sure our mobile web pages are great. We don't make native clients for desktop operating systems. We make our web application great—for example, GitLab was the first to have merge conflict resolution in our web application. People can also use Tower or other clients. For language translations, we rely on the wider community. For code navigation, we're hesitant to introduce navigation improvements that only work for a subset of languages. For building and testing with Auto DevOps, we use Heroku Buildpacks. Outside our scope are Kubernetes and everything it depends on: Network (fabric) Flannel, Openflow, VMware NSX, Cisco ACI Proxy (layer 7) Envoy, nginx, HAProxy, traefik Ingress (north/south) Contour, Ambassador, Service mesh (east/west) Istio, Linkerd Container Scheduler we mainly focus on Kubernetes, other container schedulers are: CloudFoundry, OpenStack, OpenShift, Mesos DCOS, Docker Swarm, Atlas/Terraform, Nomad, Deis, Convox, Flynn, Tutum, GiantSwarm, Rancher Package manager Helm, ksonnet Operating System Ubuntu, CentOS, RHEL, CoreOS, Alpine Linux During a presentation of Kubernetes, Brendan Burns talks about the four Ops layers at the 2:00 mark: Application Ops Cluster Ops Kernel/OS Ops Hardware Ops GitLab helps you mainly with application ops. And where needed, we also allow you to monitor clusters and link them to application environments. But we intend to use vanilla Kubernetes, instead of something specific to GitLab. Also outside our scope are products that are not specific to developing, securing, or operating applications and digital products. Identity management: Okta and Duo, you use this mainly with SaaS applications you don't develop, secure, or operate. SaaS integration: Zapier and IFTTT Ecommerce: Shopify In scope are things that are not mainly for SaaS applications: Network security, since it overlaps with application security to some extent. Security information and event management (SIEM), since that measures applications and network. Office productivity applications, since \"We believe that all digital products should be open to contributions, from legal documents to movie scripts and from websites to chip designs\" We expect GitLab to continue to grow, and we have several ideas for possible future stages Quarterly Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) To make sure our goals are clearly defined and aligned throughout the organization, we make use of OKRs (Objectives and Key Results). Our quarterly Objectives and Key Results are publicly viewable. How we plan releases At GitLab, we strive to be ambitious, maintain a strong sense of urgency, and set aspirational targets with every release. The direction items we highlight in our kickoff are a reflection of this ambitious planning. When it comes to execution, we aim for velocity over predictability. This way, we optimize our planning time to focus on the top of the queue and deliver things fast. We schedule 100% of what we can accomplish based on past Development Department merge request rate and availability factors (vacation, contribute, etc.). See our product handbook on how we prioritize. Previous releases On our releases page, you can find an overview of the most important features of recent releases and links to the blog posts for each release. Upcoming releases GitLab releases a new version every single month. You can find the major planned features for upcoming releases on our upcoming releases page or see the upcoming features for paid tiers. Note that we often move things around, do things that are not listed, and cancel things that are listed. ML/AI at GitLab With Gitlab 15.4, Suggested Reviewers was released as our first customer-facing ML/AI technology in production features. We have additional ambitions in the near future for several types of problems. This is the focus of our new ModelOps stage. Cross-Stage efforts GitLab consistently strives to deliver a cohesive experience that enables workflows that span the DevSecOps loop. We have a number of existing capabilities and planned improvements that do just that: TBA Footnotes IDC, Worldwide DevOps Software Tools Forecast, 2020–2024, Doc # US45188520, July 2020 Edit this page View source",

    "title": "Product Principles | The GitLab Handbook",
    "content": "Product Principles These are core principles we believe world class product organizations exhibit. The goal is to build a PM system that fosters and honors these principles, in a way that works for GitLab. Principles - Processes - Categories - GitLab the Product - Being a PM - Leadership Our Product Principles These are core principles that we believe will deliver world-class products through customer-centric innovation. Our goal is to build a practice that fosters these principles with the customers’ voice at the core. Everything we do is for our customers, and we are only successful when they succeed in delivering secure software faster to their customers and internal users. We are customer zero, therefore we use our own product: Everything you put into the product should be a feature you or our Engineering team would use as part of our daily work. If the answer is no, then challenge your “why”, as there might be a better solution that will have a bigger impact for our customers. We are not our only customer: Meet with customers as much as possible as everything we do is for them. It is tempting to assume that we understand our customers through our own usage and dogfooding, but that only gets you so far and we can be wrong. Validate assumptions through strategic user research, customer interviews, and feedback sessions. We are design-led: It does not matter what customer pain points you work with Engineering to resolve if what is provided to customers is hard (or almost impossible) to use. User experience is our top priority as we have a very technical product, however it should be easy enough for someone new to DevSecOps to get started quickly. This includes everything from onboarding to shipping secure software leveraging GitLab. We value quality over velocity: Delivering incomplete features and capabilities to ensure your team achieves a defined velocity is not acceptable. Everything we ship to customers must be user validated, bug free, not introduce security vulnerabilities, be able to achieve GitLab.com scale, include documentation, and be available on all customer deployment choices simultaneously. Accruing additional technical debt in favor of velocity is also not acceptable as this leads to future quality issues around availability, scalability, reliability, and security. We value data over intuition and anecdotes: Everything we build must have success metrics we can track to ensure we are providing value to our customers. We measure outcomes, not launches, and this is only possible with experimentation and proper instrumentation. All features must be instrumented so success metrics can be tracked and adjustments to plans can be made through product usage. We fail fast and iterate with intention: Define a hypothesis on how to address a customer use case or pain point and validate (or invalidate) it quickly through problem validation. Take the outcome of the problem validation cycle and build an iteration strategy to deliver it with a focus on usability and quality. Revalidate your hypothesis through solution validation with each iteration so you can adjust plans as needed. Problem and solution validation ensures the customer voice is key in making decisions. We believe in product-led growth over unguided experiences: Our product should be GitLab’s best Sales team member, and its own biggest champion. Enable feature discovery moments to let customers know there is more value based on their usage, actions taken, or configuration choices. The more customers adopt our product’s capabilities, the more return on investment they experience, which builds more internal GitLab champions. We like to win…and we only win as a team: We win when our customers are able to successfully ship secure software faster with GitLab. This requires us to hold ourselves to the highest levels of execution and collaboration within Product across our Product Management, UX Research, Product Design, and Technical Writing teams. While teamwork within Product is necessary, it is also not sufficient. We require that same standard of execution and collaboration with our cross-functional team members across R&D and GTM. Together, as a global GitLab team, we can drive Results for Customers. How we follow our Principles Enabling Collaboration From development teams to marketing organizations, everyone needs to collaborate on digital content. Content should be open to suggestions by a wide number of potential contributors. Open contribution can be achieved by using a mergeable file format and distributed version control. The mission of GitLab is to allow everyone to collaborate on all digital content so people can cooperate effectively and achieve better results, faster. Bringing Ideas to Reality Ideas flow through many stages before they are realized. An idea originates in a chat discussion, an issue is created, it is planned in a sprint, coded in an IDE, committed to version control, tested by CI, code reviewed, deployed, monitored, and documented. Stitching together all these stages of the DevOps lifecycle can be done in many different ways. You can have a marketplace of proprietary apps from different suppliers or use a suite of products developed in isolation. As a single-application for the entire DevOps lifecycle, GitLab strives to enable you to bring ideas to production rapidly. We will do so AND avoid demonstrating our capabilities with toy app demos and simple trivial examples. That’s because we understand that building a prototype is easy, but building a production line is hard. The Minimal Valuable Change (MVC) Minimal Valuable Change (MVC) is the GitLab path to delivering the smallest measurable improvement for our users, customers, and the wider community. Our approach requires four pillars: Relentless customer focus and commitment to understanding their workflows, using research and validation Measurable outcomes that use established metrics for success in tracking adoption, usage, or other business outcomes. Product functionality that adheres to GA criteria listed in the levels of support Future vision to expand the MVC beyond the initial release When considering how to scope a feature for a release, remember that it is not ok to ship an “incomplete” feature to customers (see the definition of done).

Product functionality that adheres to GA criteria listed in the levels of support Future vision to expand the MVC beyond the initial release When considering how to scope a feature for a release, remember that it is not ok to ship an “incomplete” feature to customers (see the definition of done). Consider the use of Pajamas components for UI in your MVCs. When introducing a new component or pattern not found within Pajamas, it is the responsibility of that team to follow our component lifecycle guidelines to determine whether it should be added and, if so, contribute the addition/update back to Pajamas. MVC means reducing the scope so we can ship quickly. It doesn’t mean shipping something that hurts the usability of GitLab. First impressions are important. A feature that does not offer enough value or hinders the user experience may have a negative effect that discourages users from trying that feature again in the future. If there are obvious gaps in your MVC or you can anticipate follow-up requests, consider whether your feature is complete enough to be released to users. If you are unsure whether your feature is complete enough to be an MVC (or if you know your feature is not complete enough to be an MVC and you want to gather additional feedback), you can use approaches such as dogfooding, beta programs, feature flags, and/or user research to help build confidence in your decision. In terms of talking about your feature, it’s ok to add a release post item that announces your incomplete feature (making clear that it is an early iteration, and points to the direction for the feature) and follow up in a later release post with a new item when you’ve completed more of the functionality. As long as you call it cookie dough, not a cookie, it manages user expectations. Examples: Ship a feature through the API and not the UI - See this release post as a great example of this approach was used to build a GraphQL endpoint for deleting attachment from a project. Exposing a minimal set of functionality - See this release post where a basic read-only page displaying queued jobs was added and more capabilities were added in subsequent releases. There are scenarios when an MVC approach is not advised. These include: When changing core parts of the experience - An example of a core experience is comments. When building this out for work items, we waited to release the new feature to end users until we reached parity with comments in Issues and MRs. Iteration An MVC approach is a byproduct of our spirit of iteration. That means we break problems down as small as possible, and focus on reduced cycle time. Thinking iteratively is not always intuitive, and breaking certain topics or projects down can be challenging. Here’s a helpful video from our CEO with guidance on how to think more iteratively. Here is a great video that illustrates how to build MVCs using Iteration. It shows Lego climbing obstacles. The first design fails. The second one can climb a book and so on. It also illustrates how modularity and good interfaces help with iteration as things get complex. Iteration speed and product excellence To ensure that our efforts consistently deliver value to our users, each iteration must adhere to the following guidelines: Define Expected Impact: Clearly articulate the expected measurable positive impact of the iteration on users, ensuring alignment with our overall product direction and guided by a vision that has been informed by user research. Establish Metrics for Success: Identify specific metrics that will be used to evaluate the success of the iteration before declaring the feature GA or an iteration shippable. These should be concrete, measurable indicators that directly relate to the intended outcomes of the iteration. These metrics should define a measurable quality bar as part of the initial scoping as that allows the cross-functional team to understand what the success/quality criteria are before beginning to build, while also allowing these metrics to be measured during the entire development and post-release lifecycle. As part of defining the quality bar a test plan should be defined and agreed that it can measure against these measures for success. Quality targets include: No S1 or blocking S2 defects/bug that prevents the customer from using the feature Not impacting or severely degrading the stability of the GitLab instance Success of an initiative is not measured by the deployment of a change or the completion of an iteration. True success is determined by whether the iteration achieved its predefined objectives, as evidenced by tangible business and product metrics. Example: Effort: Reduce latency in Service A. Iteration A: Implement regional upgrades in key locations. Success Metrics: Evaluate the iteration’s success by measuring increased usage and user satisfaction with Service A. Relevant metrics might include service usage rates, user adoption levels, repeat usage statistics, and revenue increases following the upgrade. We celebrate achievements when we can clearly see that an iteration or launch has resulted in tangible value for our users.

    "content": "understand what the success/quality criteria are before beginning to build, while also allowing these metrics to be measured during the entire development and post-release lifecycle. As part of defining the quality bar a test plan should be defined and agreed that it can measure against these measures for success. Quality targets include: No S1 or blocking S2 defects/bug that prevents the customer from using the feature Not impacting or severely degrading the stability of the GitLab instance Success of an initiative is not measured by the deployment of a change or the completion of an iteration. True success is determined by whether the iteration achieved its predefined objectives, as evidenced by tangible business and product metrics. Example: Effort: Reduce latency in Service A. Iteration A: Implement regional upgrades in key locations. Success Metrics: Evaluate the iteration’s success by measuring increased usage and user satisfaction with Service A. Relevant metrics might include service usage rates, user adoption levels, repeat usage statistics, and revenue increases following the upgrade. We celebrate achievements when we can clearly see that an iteration or launch has resulted in tangible value for our users. Subtractive thinking Humans tend to favor solutions that add features than solutions that remove them, even when removing features is more efficient - great PMs recognize this bias and utilize subtractive thinking to create great user experiences. Customers will tell us when we’re missing something they need, but they’re unlikely to explicitly tell us when we’re overwhelming them with unwanted features. However, we do have evidence that this challenge is already a consideration for us, as reflected consistently in our System Usability Scale verbatims. Here is an episode on the Hidden Brain podcast that explores this bias further. SaaS First Our customers choose SaaS because it reduces their operating costs, helps them adopt the latest capabilities without performing upgrades, and provides them peace of mind of high availability. This principle implies the following: Design features so that they can be released without downtime. Release features in SaaS before self-managed or alongside it. This principle does not mean SaaS only. For more information on parity between SaaS and self-managed, see our parity principle. Feedback issues An MVC approach allows for maximum feedback while iterating. To help gather that feedback, Product Managers are encouraged to create feedback issues (example) to consolidate suggestions and experiences from users. Consider mentioning the feedback issue in any release post items and related implementation issue(s) for awareness. Feedback issues allow GitLab team members and the wider GitLab community to offer thoughts and suggestions for future iteration. Feedback issues are particularly encouraged for major new customer-facing features. These issues can be closed at the end of the milestone following the milestone when they were introduced. Celebrate and Learn from Failures It’s important that team members know they are encouraged by E-group to continue moving fast as GitLab grows and gets bigger as a company. This involves moving quickly even in the face of risk and complexity. In alignment with our transparency value, we’d like to celebrate examples of failures or mistakes that were made while moving fast, where we ultimately learned from it and moved on. The following failures provided by the product team are celebrated as opportunities to gain insight, share learnings and move on with additional knowledge: We initially believed we should create a lift and shift translator for Jenkins, but learned from users and technical experts that it wasn’t technically feasible and it would be better to invest in more detailed documentation and guidance. With Auto DevOps, we discovered the desire for composability and the need to iterate on your DevOps platform makes a one-pipeline fits all capability miss the mark for tackling that user pain. We integrated with some monitoring and observability tools as MVCs (Jaeger) that were just too MVC to give us data points on their success. We relied upon “MVC” not including on by default and usable by default - resulting in lots of MVCs that we thought would garner us new information, but did not. We spent time delivering a marketplace offering, and had very little traction. We learned marketplace offerings alone are not a vehicle for adoption, and we need a sales alignment with the marketplace vendor to achieve success. We had duplication of effort between Quality and Distribution. We didn’t recognize / resolve this for too long. We have learned to better integrate Quality into the planning process. Data telemetry in general has been one of our failures. We didn’t invest in telemetry seriously or early enough, and we attempted to accelerate via a 3rd party, but didn’t do a good enough job talking to our community on the best ways to roll that out. We failed to capture significant users with APM. Internal Deck for Reference Historically, designers had been instructed to not spend time on problem validation, but we had a PM who realized in order for her group to be successful, she needed her design counterpart to be deeply involved in validation work. We learned that GitLab’s original Serverless strategy was dependent on immature technology and not necessarily aligned with the market winner Lambda. This resulted in GitLab stopping investment in Serverless. We recognized a big gap in security concerns with GitLab managed clusters, which was prohibiting this feature from being adopted by customers. Once we learned from this ‘failure’ we introduced the Kubernetes agent instead. If you have a failure that can serve as a learning opportunity, please make an MR to this page Avoid “Not Invented Here” Syndrome Just because something is not invented here doesn’t mean it doesn’t have a perfect home within our solution. GitLab is an Open Core product and is part of the broader ecosystem of Open Source tools in the market. Every day there are new innovative open source tools out there that solve real-world customer problems; we should not be afraid of embedding these tools into our own products in order to solve those same problems for our customers too.",

GitLab is an Open Core product and is part of the broader ecosystem of Open Source tools in the market. Every day there are new innovative open source tools out there that solve real-world customer problems; we should not be afraid of embedding these tools into our own products in order to solve those same problems for our customers too. Leveraging existing technology allows us to get to market much more quickly, to contribute to Open Source (and help strengthen Open Source as a whole), and allows us to focus our own people on making GitLab itself better. Building professional relationships with these tool creators also is a positive for GitLab since they may have important user perspectives around your categories. We have achieved many successes following this approach: Code Quality in CI/CD pipelines by embedding CodeClimate Feature Flags by using the Unleash client library Mobile publishing by writing about how to utilize FastLane with GitLab There are also many more examples throughout the company where this has been successful. As a product manager you should be monitoring the world of Open Source as it relates to your area to see where new innovative tools are being developed, and not be afraid of integrating those. One thing to keep in mind, integrating could be anything from a blog post describing how the tool works together with GitLab all the way up to bundling it inside of our own installation, and this can evolve iteratively. Convention over Configuration We understand that a natural inclination when using application development tools is to create an array of buttons to press and knobs to turn. We believe, however, that adding options to an application does not necessarily improve the user’s experience of that application. The best way to serve our users is to create an application that reduces complexity while still offering the features they need. Inspiration We admire other “convention over configuration” tools—like Ruby on Rails (the doctrine of which perfectly describes the value of integrated systems), Ember, and Heroku—and we strive to offer the same advantages for continuous delivery of software. Furthermore, Ruby on Rails has significantly and positively influenced the Ruby community, uplifting the tool and making it more powerful and useful than ever before. We want GitLab to be to Kubernetes what Rails is to Ruby. You should prefer well-considered choices based on current best practices. Avoid unnecessary configuration. Avoid configuration to support fragile workflows. Configuration Principles When considering adding new configuration, we follow the following principles: Ensure a great experience by default - GitLab should work perfectly right out of the box for most users. While it should be resisted, sometimes configuration is inevitable or preferable. Your configuration must not make that experience worse and should always get out of the way of the user. GitLab.com values should be the default - the settings used on GitLab.com should be the defaults for self-managed. Not only does this provide a consistent experience for users, but we get the highest fidelity feedback via GitLab.com. If we find that the GitLab.com setting is wrong, it is usually wrong for self-managed too. If you believe you have a strong case for using custom (non-default) settings for GitLab.com, please document the justification in alignment with your Product Section Lead. Any custom (non-default) settings for GitLab.com need to be tracked here. Encourage favorable behaviors by limiting configuration - Convention also implies that we’re encouraging our customers to do things in a certain way. A very concrete example of this is the ability to disable pipelines. We believe that our integrated solution will give a superior user experience and we’re motivated to encourage this behavior. For this reason, adding a configuration to allow disabling this permanently (be that in a template or instance-wide), is something that should be avoided. Design for users not intermediaries - GitLab should avoid falling into the Blackboard trap of building a product that administrators of GitLab love because it is configurable, but developers and other users of GitLab hate because it is overly complex and confusing. Working by Default - From the perspective of someone using GitLab, the feature does not exist until it works by default. This means, with few exceptions, features should simply work on GitLab.com and self-managed installations of GitLab without setup, toggling feature flags, modifying GitLab Omnibus (gitlab.rb) or Charts configurations, or installing extra components. This is more difficult than “enabled by default,” which implies that features may be available by default but then require additional effort to set up. Working by default is worth the extra thoughtfulness and effort, because it enables an extremely important outcome: It allows customers to easily adopt our entire platform and experience the benefits of a single app for the entire DevOps lifecycle. In order to be properly working by default a feature needs two things: Enabled-by-default - it must not require modifying GitLab Omnibus (gitlab.rb) or Charts configurations, installing extra components on the host machine, or be behind a feature flag. When features are not enabled-by-default most people will never benefit from it because admin access to the GitLab application or the host machine will be needed. Feature flags should",

    "content": "but developers and other users of GitLab hate because it is overly complex and confusing. Working by Default - From the perspective of someone using GitLab, the feature does not exist until it works by default. This means, with few exceptions, features should simply work on GitLab.com and self-managed installations of GitLab without setup, toggling feature flags, modifying GitLab Omnibus (gitlab.rb) or Charts configurations, or installing extra components. This is more difficult than “enabled by default,” which implies that features may be available by default but then require additional effort to set up. Working by default is worth the extra thoughtfulness and effort, because it enables an extremely important outcome: It allows customers to easily adopt our entire platform and experience the benefits of a single app for the entire DevOps lifecycle. In order to be properly working by default a feature needs two things: Enabled-by-default - it must not require modifying GitLab Omnibus (gitlab.rb) or Charts configurations, installing extra components on the host machine, or be behind a feature flag. When features are not enabled-by-default most people will never benefit from it because admin access to the GitLab application or the host machine will be needed. Feature flags should be consistently ON for both GitLab.com and self-managed users whenever possible. Enabled-by-default can be rolled out incrementally. A feature can sometimes be activated within days via a feature flag on GitLab.com. Other times a feature can take months to prove that it has the performance and visibility enterprises need. Setup-by-default - it should not require the setup before the feature can be used. We should ensure every feature has sensible defaults, and automatically migrate existing users/groups/projects to have the new features setup by default, while ensuring that the security and infrastructure costs would not be substantially affected. It is important to remember that most people are not likely to take the extra effort to setup a new feature, nor will they be aware that the feature has been added. The vocal proponents of issues who a Product Manager might interact with would likely be inclined to take the extra effort to setup a feature, but most people will not. Avoid Limits - Limits should be in place to protect the system but not to “slowly try out” a feature. By limiting the usefulness of a feature right from the start the only thing you are achieving is limiting its adoption and usefulness. If you are going to default to OFF or limited, you must have a good, documented reason for this. Avoid configuration completely when possible - Requests for configuration can be a proxy for trying to support a fragile workflow. Rather than enabling bad habits and incurring product debt, effort should be spent helping customers adopt best practices. Configuration builds up over time - Every configuration option in GitLab multiplies its complexity, which means the application is harder to use, harder to develop, and less friendly to users. Configuration is hard to remove - Removing a configuration after it shipped and in use is much more work than not introducing it in the first place. This is because you change the behavior for customers that selected the less popular option. Configuration is an expensive testing mechanism - It’s a natural reaction to propose a big change to be configurable, as you worry it’ll negatively affect certain users. However, by making a feature configurable, you’ve now created two problems to maintain going forward. Adding a configuration is a one way door that should be avoided if possible. As a result, consider using feature flags instead of configuration. Always Allow for Deploying to Production Sometimes fast deployments are needed to fix a service or application outage that can cost a business money and reputation, we understand time is of the essence in these situations. That’s why we believe giving the team control over this is important in crucial moments of the development lifecycle. Controls that prevent changes from reaching Production are okay as safeguards, but they should be able to be quickly removed or disabled if necessary. When controls are changed in this way, logs or records should be created to support post-mortem analysis and allow for understanding why the control needed to be removed or disabled. Design for self-managed for feature parity between deployments We want to provide the same capabilities to end users regardless of the method they choose to use GitLab (GitLab SaaS, Dedicated or Self-managed). All GitLab SaaS environments leverage the same installation method available to self-managed users, with a different licensing structure. By designing and implementing features for self-managed, we achieve maximum parity between the various installations. A few examples: Design features to avoid downtime since it’s not acceptable for SaaS nor self-managed users. It is ok to release functionality to SaaS first, as long as the solution is applicable for self-managed too. While a feature can be enabled first on SaaS via a feature flag or setting, the underlying implementation must also exist, although disabled, on self-managed. In line with our SaaS-first principle, some features may be released on SaaS to gain operational experience and apply learnings prior to recommending and supporting customers using it. Features would be present on self-managed codebase but are disabled until General Availability. For functionality where implementation may be especially challenging without cloud services, for example with AI, self-managed functionality may be dependent on an underlying SaaS service. This allows us to provide end users the same capabilities regardless of deployment type, and not overly constrain our feature set or impose significant operational complexities on each deployment. Product managers need to be aware that this may impact the adoption of these features, as not all customers may be willing or able to leverage underlying SaaS services, such as air-gapped deployments.

Work with VP, Product Management to add your request to the Product Scale agenda describing the situation and request for exception to gain CEO approval.",

Principled adherence to the established knowledge architecture Exception to this product principle requires CEO approval. Work with VP, Product Management to add your request to the Product Scale agenda describing the situation and request for exception to gain CEO approval. Our simplicity and SaaS/Self-Managed Parity principles require that we adhere to our established knowledge architecture. Our established architecture is Organization, Group and Project. When we need to add capabilities that an admin needs to apply across the entire organization, then we provide them at the organization level. When we need to add capabilities that need to apply across all projects in a group, but not applicable to all groups in an organization, then we provide them at a group level. When we need to add capabilities that need to apply across a specific project, but not all projects in a group, then we provide them at a project level. For capabilities our users want applied to a set of groups, it is tempting to create another aggregation concept for a “set of groups”. We do not consider that until it is available both at the project and group level for a few months. The solution is to implement it for all groups at the organization level or for each group in the set individually. For capabilities our users want applied to a set of projects, it is tempting to create another aggregation concept for a “set of projects”. We do not consider that until it is available both at the project and group level for a few months. The solution is to implement it for all projects at the group level or for each project in the set individually. Note: This implies that we will take pains to avoid instance-level features as we expect to move all capabilities from instance to organization over time. Take pains to avoid instance-level features After making a tier decision on a new feature, we should strive to maximize the number of users who can use it. As part of this objective, we should avoid building instance-level features when possible. Building at the instance level (in the admin area) leads to a separation between GitLab.com and self-managed and limits your audience to self-managed customers only: Historically (and even net-new proposed features) we’ve often started with an “instance-wide” mindset which then means we need to iterate and adjust features to work at a group-level. This often delays functionality for our SaaS customers and makes GitLab.COM feel like a second-class citizen. There are factors that may justify an instance-level feature, like engineering efficiency and high infrastructure cost, but we should always have a clear view on how we might bring the feature to GitLab.com and clearly document why we started with the instance-level in the issue. Deciding whether to add configuration For a GitLab instance in gitlab.yml Product Managers at GitLab are frequently confronted with the choice of whether to add new configurations or not. These can frequently be times where an outside perspective is important. That’s why we’ve created the option to request a New Config Review. Here’s an example of how to consider whether to add new configuration. Let’s say you are proposing we add a checkbox or two radio boxes in a feature dialog box. Think carefully about what users really want. Most of the time, you’ll find you really only need one solution, so remove the other option. When two possible choices really are necessary, the best or most common one should be the default, and the other one should be available. If the non-default choices are significantly less common, then consider taking them out of the main workflow for making decisions, by putting them behind an Advanced configuration tab, for example. Avoiding configurations is not always possible. When we have no choice, the secondary priority is to configure something in the GitLab interface. A configuration should only appear in a file (gitlab.rb or gitlab.yml) as a last resort. gitlab.yml is the configuration file used by the Rails application. This is where the domain is configured. Other configurations should be moved to the UI as much as possible and no new configurations should be added here. gitlab.rb is the configuration file for Omnibus-GitLab. It acts not only as an abstraction of the configuration of gitlab.yml for GitLab-Rails, but also as the source for all configurations for services included and managed within the Omnibus-GitLab. Newly introduced services probably need to be configured here. When you have to add a new configuration, make sure that the features and services are on by default. Only add a configuration line to either of these configuration files if the feature or service cannot be fully disabled from the admin UI. For a GitLab CI configuration in .gitlab-ci.yml If the decision to add a configuration follows the principles above, add it to the repository-specific CI configuration options and be sure to default it to the option that results in the best user experience. We are much more liberal with additions to CI configurations than Instance configurations. Every feature is",

We are much more liberal with additions to CI configurations than Instance configurations. Every feature is owned by a group Features should be owned by one group, including the respective DRIs of that group. Make sure that the documentation metadata and the features.yml for your team are kept up to date to make it easier for other teams to find the correct owner. This principle is important because unowned product features are unsupervised, and continue to accrue technical debt over time. This increases the risk of performance and maintenance issues, which tend to only get resolved once the situation has become critical. In addition, by having clear DRIs for our entire surface area, teams are able to advocate for investment and/or removal of features. If you encounter a feature that does not seem to be owned or documented, work with the team that originally introduced the functionality to decide on ownership. If the feature is large and needs to be broken down, document which elements are owned by which team. If you cannot decide who should own the feature, escalate the decision to the lowest common reporting line between the involved teams. If there are features that no group wants to own, or features that a group no longer wants to own, that feature should be considered for deprecation and removal. User Experience A highly usable interface with cohesive workflows and comprehensive documentation is a must to stay ahead of our best-in-class competitors. Work closely with the individuals in UX to achieve our user experience goals. The UX team has a high level of expertise in Product Design, Technical Writing, and UX Research. They can help decipher or decide how to simplify or avoid complexity. While our Product Designers review user interface changes in merge requests, they are not limited to just the UI. Anything that impacts the user journey is relevant to them. Keep in mind these general user experience principles. Strive for simplicity: Using GitLab should be easy. Users should think about the applications they are building and the teams they are collaborating with, not how to make our app work. Here’s a great read on “Don’t make users think!” Depth over breadth: A world-class experience requires deep, powerful, useful features. To remain balanced, we must also identify capabilities that can be deprecated so we are adding depth while encouraging subtractive thinking. Better than before: Our MVC principle pushes back against the notion that something must be better than nothing. Instead, we assess if the user experience is better than before by considering its value. Work with a Product Designer to evaluate tradeoffs and minimize deferred UX. Timeless design: The user experience should be relevant both today and years from now, so each release should encapsulate the best experience possible. Ask yourself, “How would we build something if we knew this was the last time a team could touch it?” Additionally, you can familiarize yourself with the UX team mission and GitLab’s Pajamas design system principles. Be Ambitious Many crazy, over-ambitious ideas sound like they are impossible just because no one else is doing them. Since we have amazing engineers and a culture of shipping minimal valuable changes, we are able to accomplish many more “impossible” things than other organizations. That’s why we’re shipping merge conflict resolution, why we shipped built-in CI before anyone else, why we built a better static pages solution, and why we’re able to compete. How this impacts Planning Here at GitLab, we are an ambitious company and this means we aim for big things with every release. The reality of taking chances and planning aspirationally means that we won’t always be able to deliver everything that we wanted to try in every release, and similar to our OKRs, we believe this is a good thing. We don’t want to shy away from challenging ourselves and always want to keep a sense of urgency, and aiming for more helps us do that. Also see the importance of velocity We arrived at our preference for ambitious planning after measuring our velocity and finding that our velocity was unchanged whether we scheduled ambitiously or scheduled for providing slack. Discoverability without being annoying Discovering new features can enhance the experience and unlock significant value for users. And the more users see and try our features, the faster we can get feedback to improve them. However, excessive feature discovery efforts can become irritating for users. This erodes trust and reduces engagement with other UI elements in the future. Even worse, they might leave GitLab due to this deteriorating experience. Context plays a significant role in how users engage with new functionality. By presenting features in a way that resonates with a user’s current situation and needs you increase the liklihood of them using this new functionality. Work with your product designer to improve the discoverability of your features. The Pajamas Design System has best",

Product Qualified Leads (PQLs) As the GitLab userbase and team members who work on GitLab continue to grow we need to support both our users and team members by helping to connect users who may be interested in speaking with a member of the sales team to that particular person. We can call this a Product Qualified Lead or a PQL. A PQL can be further broken down into two types, usage and hand-raise Usage: A usage-based PQL is a user or a team (group or instance) that adopted the product to the level that we had data to support that they are statistically more likely to upgrade to a subscription compared to our remaining userbase. When this level of product adoption is achieved by the user or team an alert is triggered for the sales team to follow up with the user and/or team. The level of usage that triggers a usage-based PQL is something that will be determined and agreed upon between Product, Marketing, and Sales as the goal is to generate quality leads for the sales team. When the usage-based definition is agreed upon it will be added here. Hand-Raise: A hand-raise PQL is a user who requests to speak to sales from within the product. Our goal is to introduce these hand-raise moments throughout the product at feature discovery moments, or moments where a user is learning more about a paid feature or tier of GitLab that they may find valuable. These moments should be contextually relevant to their usage and non-obtrusive see Discoverability Without Being Annoying. A hand-raise moment in the product should be accompanied by either a trial CTA or a touchless upgrade CTA or both. We want to always provide options to our users as we want them to decide the path that best suits their needs. Clarifiying out what a PQL is not A PQL is not a user that has only signed up for the product, they have not achieved a qualified status. A PQL is not a trial, a trial is a separate user adoption path. It’s important to note that a user could start a trial and then become a PQL or vice versa. The future vision of PQLs within the GitLab product Our goal is to develop a world-class PQL system whereby we monitor product usage to understand and constantly iterate on what constitutes a usage-based PQL and provide a unified intelligent interface in the product where users can submit a hand-raise, start a trial or upgrade touchlessly. By monitoring product usage, usage PQL volume, SAO rate, and ASP we will be able to work in partnership with marketing and sales to ensure we’re sending high quality leads to the sales team. In the product experience, we will develop an intelligent module for feature discovery moments whereby we help recommend what we believe should be the preferred option for the user whether it’s a hand-raise, trial or touchless upgrade by updating the default CTA based on their usage of the product along with demographic and firmographic data. This experience will be present on both SaaS and self-managed instances for air-gapped instances the CTAs will provide the user with external URLs to visit to complete the associated step. This experience should be able to be deployed by any stage to further their paid adoption rate. Drive Product Usage Users can only experience GitLab’s value when they actively use the product features. Therefore the Product team’s mission isn’t only shipping features and building products, but also driving usage and delivering value. There are two frameworks we use to think about driving GitLab’s product usage: we use the AARRR framework to think about how to drive a single feature’s usage, and use the Customer Adoption Journey to think about cross-adoption of product features. These two frameworks are also interconnected with each other. Single Feature usage: AARRR framework AARRR stands for Acquisition, Activation, Retention, Revenue, and Referral which is often referred to as “Pirate Metrics”. These five words represent the customer journey and the various means a product manager may apply Product Performance Indicators to drive a desired behavior in the funnel. While the AARRR framework is commonly used to drive overall active users, it is also a great way for PMs to think about how to drive feature usage. Acquisition measures user actions that show awareness of the feature Activation illustrates a user has begun to apply the feature Retention is the continued use of the feature over time Revenue captures the monetary value acquired from feature",

Therefore the Product team’s mission isn’t only shipping features and building products, but also driving usage and delivering value. There are two frameworks we use to think about driving GitLab’s product usage: we use the AARRR framework to think about how to drive a single feature’s usage, and use the Customer Adoption Journey to think about cross-adoption of product features.

These five words represent the customer journey and the various means a product manager may apply Product Performance Indicators to drive a desired behavior in the funnel. While the AARRR framework is commonly used to drive overall active users, it is also a great way for PMs to think about how to drive feature usage. Acquisition measures user actions that show awareness of the feature Activation illustrates a user has begun to apply the feature Retention is the continued use of the feature over time Revenue captures the monetary value acquired from feature usage Referral focuses on measuring behaviors that drive users to encourage others to consume the feature classDiagram Acquistion --|> Activation Acquistion : Are users aware of the product or feature set? Acquistion: Measurement (Insert Metric) Activation --|> Retention Activation : Are users applying the feature? Activation: Measurement (Insert Metric) Retention --|> Revenue Retention : Are users applying the feature over time? Retention: Measurement (Insert Metric) Revenue --|> Referral Revenue : Are users paying for the features? Revenue: Measurement (Insert Metric) Referral --|> Acquistion Referral : Are users encouraging others to use the feature? Referral: Measurement (Insert Metric) Add AARRR funnels for your stage or group’s Product Performance Indicators directly with mermaid markdown. It’s easy if you use this live editor. Product managers can use these various states to prioritize features that drive a desired action. This could mean focusing on the Activation metric to drive awareness and generate more top of funnel leads. As an example, in the Release stage the Release Management group tracks actions on the Release Page in GitLab. Users that view a Release Page have been acquired and those that create a release on a Release Page are activated users. The Product Manager can choose to target features that drive users to view the Release Page more, resulting in a greater interest in the number of users that become activated and create their own Releases. Multi-feature usage: Adoption Journey GitLab is a complete DevOps platform. Our customers get the most value out of the GitLab product when they use multiple features together. Below is the most common path our customers follow to adopt GitLab’s product stages. As PMs, in addition to driving usage of individual features, we should also proactively think about how to design product and user experiences to help users adopt more stages and features, therefore benefiting more from using GitLab. graph TD; id1(Create - 99%) --> id2(Plan - 91%) id3(Verify - 84%) --> id4(Secure - 36%) id1 --> id5(Manage - 35%) id1 ==> |Golden Journey|id3(Verify - 86%) id3 ==> |Golden Journey|id6(Release - 54%) id3 --> id7(Package - 7%) id6 --> id9(Monitor - 8%) id6 --> id10(Configure - 2%) id6 --> id11(Software Supply Chain Security - 28%) The percentage here is defined as % of monthly active paid ultimate-tier self-managed instances that adopted that stage. The data is captured directly in the Golden Journey Paths chart (which has been deprecated). The Golden Journey: The bolded path is the “Golden Journey” where we observe as the most common stages adopted by paid customers and serve as foundation to adopt other stages: it starts from Create, then goes to Verify and Release. If the Golden Journey is complete, all stages of GitLab are available for use. Our biggest opportunity is to improve Verify to Release adoption rate. Note: There are numerous potential variants to this adoption journey, but it’s important to keep this representation simple and consistent. Please check with David DeSanto first before making any changes to the adoption journey image. Flow One Shipping only MVCs can result in a large set of loosely connected pieces that don’t necessarily combine into a single, great user experience. An obvious solution to this would be to plan out the future in detail, creating a long-term detailed plan. However, this is unwanted as it can restrict your flexibility and ability to respond to changing needs or feedback. Flow One offers an alternative. You draw out a workflow consisting of MVCs (that can be shipped individually). The workflow should only cover a specific, narrow use-case, and nothing more. This means you: avoid creating an inflexible, long-term plan can more easily construct a full feature/ capability, which is more easily marketed can provide context to each individual change (“we need this as part of X”) can continue to ship MVCs work concurrently on several items, none of which are blocking Flow One should cover the first iteration of a particular workflow. After this, individual MVCs can be introduced to expand the use-cases or loosen the assumptions (e.g. from a feature that can only be used if you’re using feature branches, to one that works for other git strategies). Data-driven work Using data to learn from our users is important. Our users are spread across GitLab.com and self-managed instances, so we have to focus our efforts on learning and providing benefit to both when we decide to collect more data, or build and use additional analytics tools. If we do this, we can help make the rest of the company successful as well. This means that we should: Build and use tools that work for both GitLab.com and self-managed. Start from a question, and build / collect what we need to answer that question. This avoids wasting time with data we don’t need. Use and improve existing tools we have inside",

    "content": "easily construct a full feature/ capability, which is more easily marketed can provide context to each individual change (“we need this as part of X”) can continue to ship MVCs work concurrently on several items, none of which are blocking Flow One should cover the first iteration of a particular workflow. After this, individual MVCs can be introduced to expand the use-cases or loosen the assumptions (e.g. from a feature that can only be used if you’re using feature branches, to one that works for other git strategies). Data-driven work Using data to learn from our users is important. Our users are spread across GitLab.com and self-managed instances, so we have to focus our efforts on learning and providing benefit to both when we decide to collect more data, or build and use additional analytics tools. If we do this, we can help make the rest of the company successful as well. This means that we should: Build and use tools that work for both GitLab.com and self-managed. Start from a question, and build / collect what we need to answer that question. This avoids wasting time with data we don’t need. Use and improve existing tools we have inside of GitLab before leaning towards off-the-shelf products. Our customers, sales team and customer success teams all benefit greatly from similar insights into their usage as the product team does. Make things that help all of these people. No artificial limits in Core Per GitLab Stewardship, we will not introduce artificial limits in Core. Artificial means arbitrarily setting a small number (such as: 1) as a limit on a given GitLab object category, that would incur no additional effort or cost had we chosen a larger number. The additional effort includes product, design, and engineering effort to create the feature in the first place, and to maintain it over time. For example, GitLab Core has the issue board feature in every project. In GitLab EE, each project supports multiple boards. This does not mean that Core has an artificial limit of one board per project, because there is additional effort to manage multiple boards such as supporting the navigation interface, and all the associated engineering work. This principle does not apply to our SaaS offering as limits are occasionally introduced to limit our hosting costs and protect other users from potential abuse. As an example we have shared runner minute quotas and implement rate limiting. Avoid enforced workflows but allow enterprise flexibility We’re discussing enforced workflows in this issue. Enforced workflows should be avoided in GitLab. For example, there are three issue states (Open, In Progress (as of 10.2), and Closed), and any issue should be allowed to transition from one state to any other state without workflow restrictions. (Roles and permissions is a separate concern.) Enforced workflows restrict GitLab to a smaller number of use cases, thus reducing the value of GitLab. Enforced workflows require overhead to maintain in the product. Each new feature must account for any existing enforced workflows. We should trust our users to use GitLab responsibly, giving them freedom, instead of imposing enforced workflows that we think made sense at the time of design and implementation. A comment on Hacker News perfectly details what can go wrong when enforcing workflows: “The down side for the true end-users, those who actually use the software day-to-day, is that most business processes are awful. If your experience is the hellish existence that I see strolled about on threads where JIRA comes up …: Your admin(s) set it up once and hasn’t bothered to iterate on those workflows. The business mapped their autonomy stripping processes onto JIRA intentionally. I’d guess that most of your work experience is similar. Process stifled nonsense.” But that comment also specifies the advantage: “JIRA’s most powerful feature is that it affords for mapping businesses processes onto software. This is incredibly compelling to enterprise customers. Software that enforces workflows, procedures and requirements can be an incredible lever and JIRA’s price point makes build vs buy decisions an absolute no-brainer.” We should ensure that GitLab makes it easy to help with enterprise workflows: When starting a branch with an issue (number) we link it to the branch. When merging an MR you automatically close the issue(s) it fixes. In GitLab CI you can define your deployment stage progression (staging, pre-production, production) including manual approval. We run quality and security tools automatically and provide dashboards to check status instead of making it a step in the process. We limit the impact of mistakes with incremental rollout and automatic rollback. When considering a customer need for enforcement or limitations: Deeply understand and document the underlying customer problem. It’s our responsibility to understand the need we are solving for before we even consider imposing controls. Solve for individual use cases first. Trying to solve a specific problem with a non-specific solution is risky and not iterative. Instead, start with a single use case and build a specific, non-enforced solution in GitLab. Consider the smallest group of users first. Don’t reach for instance-wide controls, but instead iterate from the smallest segment possible (e.g. a sub-set of projects). Provide simple workarounds and overrides. Consider extreme scenarios like recovering from a SEV-1 incident; there should always be a simple, fast escape hatch. As an example, customers requested instance-wide enforcement through required CI jobs. Doing this would have been a mistake. Instead: We understood their problem more deeply, and realized we could build capabilities to perform these checks in existing primitives (like external rules in MR approvals). We limited the scope of the problem, and avoided any limitations at the instance-level. Instead, we planned to keep the impact as small as possible by requiring customers to scope this feature to only projects with a particular compliance framework. We intentionally planned for workarounds. A developer should be able to override these limitations inside merge requests, such as with two-person approvals. They should also be able to create subgroups that aren’t subject to these controls. While",

They should also be able to create subgroups that aren’t subject to these controls. While workflow enforcement should be avoided in most cases, there are organizations that rely on enforced workflows for a variety of reasons. These organizations have problems adapting existing workflows as they move to GitLab and as a result, we should consider allowing some enforcement at the group level in order to balance team efficiency and organizational policy. Page 79 of [Accelerate](https://www.amazon.com/Accelerate-Software-Performing-Technology-Organizations/dp/1942788339) outlines \"teams that reported no approval process or used peer review achieved higher software delivery performance.\" As we implement features to allow organizations to enforce workflows, we should do so at the group level and default them off. GitLab should be a product teams use to accelerate product development, but flexible enough to solve for requirements of all sizes of organizations. Prefer small primitives Small primitives are building blocks in GitLab. They are an abstraction not at the technical level, but truly at the product level. Small primitives can be combined, built-upon further, and otherwise leveraged to create new functionality in GitLab. For example, the label lists in issue boards use the smaller primitive of labels. They are especially powerful because they usually take less effort and provide higher leverage than you would get from a more “complete” but standalone feature. Think of how simple Unix command line utilities can be chained together to do really complicated things, much easier (and certainly more flexibly) than you could have done with a dedicated tool. When iterating on GitLab, strongly consider using small primitives instead of creating new abstractions, especially when considering MVC features that will provide the foundations for further improvements. To do this you can start with easy to apply concepts that meet the needs of intermediate to advanced users; from here document the usage clearly and be sure to think about discoverability. The UX can very often be refactored or enhanced later when there’s a demonstrated need for refinement, onboarding for less sophisticated users, or other new abstractions needed that were identified through real-world usage. Component Principles In GitLab the product, it is sometimes the case that optional software or infrastructure is required to enable new capabilities. Some examples include: Infrastructure in the form of Runners are required to enable use of GitLab CI/CD Infrastructure and software in the form of Elasticsearch is required to enable Advanced Search Software in the form of the Kubernetes Agent is required to enable GitOps pull-based workflows The following are best practices we consider when building such components. Start with enabling Developers As we learned with GitLab CI/CD, the ability for developers to quickly attach needed Runners to enable their own use of GitLab CI/CD allowed for rapid adoption of GitLab CI/CD within an organization. When considering the workflow to enable additional capabilities, start with enabling developers first. A guiding principle should be low-friction developer enablement, which will positively impact adoption. Build for production use, not demo use As we learned from the certificate-based Kubernetes Integration, building starting experiences that support demoing a getting-started process doesn’t necessarily translate into real usage. For example, the certificate-based integration lacked strong security primitives and the ability to manage the integration on an ongoing basis. As a result, we should build capabilities that target real-world production use first, even as part of MVCs. Integrate other applications thoughtfully GitLab’s vision is to be the best single application for every part of the DevOps toolchain. However, some customers use tools other than our included features, and we respect those decisions. With this in mind, it’s sometimes valuable to integrate with 3rd-party services and products to help bridge the gaps in their toolchain. While a single application is the best approach, multiple applications that work well together is better than ones that don’t. With this in mind, below are some product guidelines to consider: Don’t clone everything Don’t feel like we need to clone every feature of an integrated product. Ultimately, this approach costs us the most possible resources, while creating an experience that will always be sub-par compared to the native one offered by the other application. We should focus our efforts on places where we can deliver value by helping bridge the gap between the two applications. Here are some potential (completely theoretical) examples, highlighting the difference between cloning vs. bridging: In an event log, surface only recent activity and link to a full log on the other system, instead of trying to display all records inside of GitLab. In an issue/ticket, offer only the most used functionality, like commenting or status changes, instead of trying to replicate all possible actions. Prevent broken workflows for free Based on the quote above: “While a single application is the best approach, multiple applications that work well together is better than ones that don’t.” Features and UX that might break a customers workflow should be offered freely. In particular, we should",

    "content": "approach, multiple applications that work well together is better than ones that don’t. With this in mind, below are some product guidelines to consider: Don’t clone everything Don’t feel like we need to clone every feature of an integrated product. Ultimately, this approach costs us the most possible resources, while creating an experience that will always be sub-par compared to the native one offered by the other application. We should focus our efforts on places where we can deliver value by helping bridge the gap between the two applications. Here are some potential (completely theoretical) examples, highlighting the difference between cloning vs. bridging: In an event log, surface only recent activity and link to a full log on the other system, instead of trying to display all records inside of GitLab. In an issue/ticket, offer only the most used functionality, like commenting or status changes, instead of trying to replicate all possible actions. Prevent broken workflows for free Based on the quote above: “While a single application is the best approach, multiple applications that work well together is better than ones that don’t.” Features and UX that might break a customers workflow should be offered freely. In particular, we should offer features that help customers avoid productivity antipatterns like allowing multiple sources of truth (multiple wikis) or duplicating work (not showing work activity on an issue). Charge for adding value to an interaction By having such an incredible breadth, GitLab has the opportunity to add value to external features that they could never otherwise have, if not integrated with GitLab. For example, our excellent To Dos feature puts actionable work at the fingertips of developers, and it’s a feature somewhat unique to GitLab. Many other tools make it harder to identify work that needs immediate action, so by integrating those tools with this part of GitLab, we can make them even more powerful than they’d be alone. Consider the right buyer for pricing While we typically think about who is using the functionality as an indicator of our buyer, this may not be appropriate for your integration. When an integration is driven by an organizational requirement (such as having all teams in the company use Jira), Buyer Based Tiering likely indicates that the integration is for multiple team (Premium) or strategic organizational (Ultimate) use. When an integration is extending GitLab capabilities, the buyer is more likely to be the end-user, similar to how we’d think about pricing other GitLab functionality. Low level of shame still applies here When we start to integrate with another product, it’s almost like opening a whole new Category of work. With this in mind, a friendly reminder that low level of shame applies, just like it would anywhere else. The integration may not be very valuable today, but it’s just a starting place, and we should use our first iteration to validate what belongs in the next one. Track the maturity of the integration Like any other category of work, we should track the maturity of the integration somewhere that’s visible. Consider adding your integration to the Ecosystem Integrations direction page, which contains a table that tracks our high-priority integrations and their maturity levels. Respect security and permissions External applications may have security and permissions concerns that we don’t have in our application. We should take careful consideration of these, since ignoring them could be potentially disastrous for our users. For example, if we ask a user for an administrative token with full access and then display content in our UI based on those privileges, we could potentially display sensitive data that shouldn’t leave that application. Navigation Integrations should be as discoverable as any native GitLab feature, if they’re enabled. In cases where the two features are mutually exclusive, we should allow the user to hide our native functionality to prevent confusion. For example, having two project management tools is a (generally) bad idea. Collaborators may end up filing issues in the wrong tool, slowing down their velocity and worsening their overall experience. Reducing velocity is antithetical to the value GitLab provides. When features aren’t mutually exclusive (there’s nothing wrong with using multiple security scanning services, for example), we should group navigation to those integrations near our own. Use empty states for feature discovery Consider adding an empty state that highlights the availability of this integration. If someone is not using the GitLab feature and also not integrating their tool of choice, that’s the worst possible experience. We should respect the choices of our users, and if they’ve decided to use a 3rd-party tool that we integrate with, we shouldn’t hide that option in a dark corner. This is also a great opportunity to educate the user on what GitLab can offer relative to other products. It’s the best of both worlds: promoting our own features while helping them improve their current experience, regardless of choice. Use our own design language Just because we’re leveraging functionality from a 3rd-party service doesn’t mean we should allow that service’s UI to dictate what ours looks like. GitLab has its own design language, and by keeping it cohesive across the application, we create a significantly better experience for our users. Be transparent about the data source When data is populated from an external source, make it clear that it comes from elsewhere. This prevents confusion, reduces cognitive load, and ensures that users are well informed about the choices they’re making when interacting with the application. Avoid plugins and commercial marketplaces Note - We intend to provide a place where everyone can contribute, such as code snippets, project templates and CI components in the CI/CD Catalog. Marketplaces are traditionally transaction based, where users are purchasing solutions. GitLab CI/CD components on the other hand, will offer an in product experience for consuming components for YAML configuration from a library of GitLab maintained components. Closed source software vendors commonly depend on plugins and commercial marketplaces because: These allow third parties the ability to add functionality without needing access to the underlying",

Closed source software vendors commonly depend on plugins and commercial marketplaces because: These allow third parties the ability to add functionality without needing access to the underlying codebase. Third parties can charge for the plugins, which gives them an incentive to build them. Because GitLab is an open core product, third parties can add functionality directly to GitLab. Adding directly to the GitLab codebase (as opposed to building a plugin) may mean more work for them and will limit the ways in which they can charge for that functionality. However, for users of GitLab, this has significant advantages: They are more likely to use this functionality, because it’s distributed to all users by default. The functionality always works out of the box, requiring no additional software. Users don’t have to search for what plugins are available, or test multiple options to see which one works the best. Installations can’t have varying combinations of plugins, making it easier to use and support the product. Administrators never have to avoid an upgrade for fear that it might break an important plugin since all code is tested together. And for developers of GitLab including the third parties, this has significant advantages as well: Their work isn’t limited in functionality, because they’re changing the code of the product itself. Their code will be tested along with the rest of the product as things change refactoring is easier, reducing the likelihood that it suffers from software atrophy because something is hard to change. Community effort is not wasted on developing multiple plugins that all ultimately do the same thing and compete with each other for usage. Developers don’t have to sacrifice velocity in favor of predictability, since they don’t have to worry about breaking the plugin API. Overall, we believe that this approach creates the best possible experience for both the users of and the contributors to GitLab, and to that end we encourage people to contribute functionality to GitLab directly. If adding code directly to GitLab isn’t an option, we encourage third-parties to integrate through our APIs. Note: GitLab does support plugins that respond to system hooks, which tie directly to application events and are primarily used for administrative purposes such as auditing, logging, and other administrative tasks. Product and feature naming guidelines Give products and features descriptive, not distinctive, names GitLab is a DevOps Platform, not a collection of DevOps point solutions; the naming of GitLab products and features should reflect this. Adopting descriptive names brings other advantages: It’s efficient. Descriptive names are generally not eligible for trademark registration, avoiding the time, effort, and expense of clearing, filing, and maintaining trademark registrations. It’s inclusive. Descriptive names are most accessible to a global audience because they can be directly translated into other languages, reducing the risk of loss of meaning inherent in translating abstract, metaphorical, or colloquial names. As an example, CI/CD Components Library is a descriptive name while CI/CD ATOM is a distinctive name. Exceptions to this principle are considered in limited circumstances - if a product or feature is a differentiator in the market, adopting a descriptive name risks it getting lost in the sea of same. Here, a distinctive name may be justified. To discuss an exception, reach out to #marketing in Slack. Use prepositions when referring to third-party products and services in names When naming a GitLab extension, plugin, app, or integration for a third-party product or service (a “tool”), either include the third-party service name with a preposition like for, or don’t include it at all. A preposition is important as it indicates that the third party isn’t officially affiliated with the tool. For example, our integration with Jira Cloud is called GitLab.com for Jira Cloud. Provided we use the tool’s full name in marketing materials and technical documentation, as exceptions to this general principle we can: (1) refer to the tool solely by the third-party service name in places where we list GitLab’s tools in product; and (2) refer to the tool solely as “GitLab” in the third-party product’s app directory. For example, we refer to the GitLab for Slack app as “Slack” in our lists of GitLab integrations, and as “GitLab” in the Slack App Directory. For more guidance on the feature naming process, see naming features. Next Generation While our big, hairy, audacious goal spans all development processes, personas, and use-cases, there are primary targets in each one of these venues. When considering prioritization we should first aim to provide complete maturity for developers building cloud native applications in a modern way prior to moving to other development methodologies, personas, and application types. Modern first When developing features to compete with existing competitors, make sure to solve problems for modern development teams first, and then see what’s missing for legacy teams. e.g. For project management, make great project management capabilities for teams doing conversational development, lean, or even agile development before doing Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) or waterfall. It’s important that modern first",

    "title": "Product Principles | The GitLab Handbook",
    "content": "and technical documentation, as exceptions to this general principle we can: (1) refer to the tool solely by the third-party service name in places where we list GitLab’s tools in product; and (2) refer to the tool solely as “GitLab” in the third-party product’s app directory. For example, we refer to the GitLab for Slack app as “Slack” in our lists of GitLab integrations, and as “GitLab” in the Slack App Directory. For more guidance on the feature naming process, see naming features. Next Generation While our big, hairy, audacious goal spans all development processes, personas, and use-cases, there are primary targets in each one of these venues. When considering prioritization we should first aim to provide complete maturity for developers building cloud native applications in a modern way prior to moving to other development methodologies, personas, and application types. Modern first When developing features to compete with existing competitors, make sure to solve problems for modern development teams first, and then see what’s missing for legacy teams. e.g. For project management, make great project management capabilities for teams doing conversational development, lean, or even agile development before doing Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) or waterfall. It’s important that modern first does not mean non-modern never. It means that we should first learn how teams are using the feature in a modern way, and then see what’s missing. The modern way provides the path forward, and then we can add customizability or the path to modern for teams who are not quite there yet. Developer first Our strategy includes going after a lot of new personas, going from developers to operations, security, product managers, designers, etc. But when developing features in these new areas, it’s important to remember to start with the developer. If we can make security great for developers and then great for security professionals, we’ll be much more successful. Cloud-native first Development teams deploy to tons of different platforms, from bare metal to cloud VMs to cloud-native Kubernetes clusters. We build features for cloud-native first, and then support the rest. This allows us to focus on where development is going, and deliver solutions that every company aspires to use eventually, even if they’re not ready to today. Prioritize current adopters By focusing on next-generation development flows, personas, and use cases - we build features and experiences where our initial users are in the relatively small population of early adopters. While we might build experiences to support them today, we presume there will always be a much larger population of future users of these experiences. Therefore, we optimize GitLab to support the larger number of current and future adopters of next-generation principles - those who are beginning to operate in the workflow (modern), team setup (developer first), or application architectures (cloud native) we support. We focus our investment in the most modern workflows that will best support those current adopters. This will come at the cost of sustained investment in initial workflows for early adopters. When doing so we will ensure we clearly communicate with our users what the preferred path is. For example - We first provided the ability to attach Kubernetes Clusters via the Certificate method. After realizing this wasn’t optimal for production use cases we added the GitLab Agent for Kubernetes method of cluster attachment. As soon as we were certain that the certificate method was no longer the preferred method we communicated via our docs and in the product that the Agent was the preferred path for current adopters. This should not mean an immediate deprecation, but a clear signal that the legacy method will become deprecated once the alternative approach is able to substitute it. Customer Support on all features We provide customer support to paying customers on all features that are in the tier of their paid license as well as any lower tiers. This means a feature in Core, should get customer support in all paid tiers. For example, when there is a feature that is available in the lowest paid tier, but only has customer support in higher tiers, the feature should be removed from that lowest paid tier. In accordance with our stewardship policy we can never remove features from Core into paid tiers, but we can build additional features around it which are available to paying customers only.

It is important to note that the information presented is for informational purposes only, so please do not rely on the information for purchasing or planning purposes.

What We Do Ops Section Vision Composition 3 Year Strategy Market Predictions Themes Ops Section Plan Why We Do It Impact Market Current Position Challenges Opportunities Useful Resources Performance Indicators Performance Indicator Goals Personas and Jobs to Be Done Who is it for? Today Medium Term (1-2 years) What We Do Ops Section Vision Our Vision for the Ops section is to set up developers for efficient and safe software delivery using the best practices in CI/CD, operations and integrated security. Composition DevSecOpsPlanCodeBuildTestReleaseDeployOperateMonitorSecurityComplianceVerifyConfigurePackageMonitorRelease The Ops Section is comprised of five stages: Verify, Package, Deploy and Analytics. For a deeper view of the direction of each specific stage please visit the respective Direction Pages linked below: Verify Package Deploy Analytics Market analysts (internal) often describe these stages as automated software quality (ASQ, partially correlated with Verify, Package and Deploy), IT automation and configuration management (ITACM, correlated with Deploy), and IT operations management (ITOM, partially correlated with Monitor). The Ops section also covers CI/CD (Verify/Deploy), IT Infrastructure Monitoring/APM (Monitor), CDRA (Deploy), Infrastructure Configuration (Deploy) and Package and Binary Management (Package) analyst categories. In some contexts, \"ops\" refers to operators. Operators were the counterparts to Developers represented in the original coining of the term DevOps. That definition highlighted the rift between the two groups and a need for collaboration. At GitLab, we use \"ops\" to mean operations - any component of the value stream delivery platform after a developer commits code. Our developer first perspective means our use of the word \"ops\" is focused on enabling developers to configure tools and perform operations tasks first. We have support for platform operations and SRE teams who provide Pipelines, Infrastructure and alert response tools to development teams, and ambitious plans to support traditional operators in the future. 3 Year Strategy GitLab's Ops strategy follows that of GitLab's company strategy. Just like our company mission, we will enable everyone to contribute beyond application code to other digital artifacts that increasingly define the performance, reliability, and resilience of the world's software. We will pursue that mission and capitalize on the opportunities (such as, developer buyer power, IT skills gaps, a move towards Kubernetes, and our roots in source-control and CI) by utilizing a dual-flywheel approach. This approach starts with attracting developers performing DevOps tooling and operations tasks to our Free/Core tier. As we build best of breed tools for them we will co-create to drive product improvements. This will generate revenue for higher product tiers and additional investment for supporting the modern development teams. More specifically, we will achieve this by enabling easy-to-discover, working-by-default, workflows that support doing powerful, complex actions with a minimum configuration. We want to take advantage of our single application so that, while each team may have their own views or dashboards in the product that support their day to day, the information is available everywhere and to everyone, embedded naturally into their day-to-day workflow where it's relevant. For example: Allow platform teams to share operational definitions (infrastructure, environments, deployment pipelines, monitoring configuration) with development teams and for development teams to easily contribute improvements to their definition At scale management of deployments with actionable analytics and dashboards to support management of development teams Operational tasks that ensure reliability, like chaos engineering and performance testing, are shifted left Software Engineers and Testers looking at an individual issue can see which environment(s) that issue has been deployed to Satisfying compliance needs and supply chain security by improving the traceability of artifacts throughout the build, test, deploy process Incident responders can immediately see details of the last deploy, recent code changes and errors, traces and logs needed to help them get their service back up quickly The end result is that even complex delivery flows become part of everyone's primary way of working. There isn't a context shift (or even worse, a switch into a different tool) needed to start thinking about delivery or operations - that information is there, in context, from your first commit. The centerpiece of this strategy is our Get Things Done Easily theme. Market Predictions The Ops Section stages represent over 50% of GitLab's future CSM expansion. In three years the Ops market will: Consider CI a critical capability for bridging between Dev, Sec & Ops to create truly high-performing DevSecOps organizations Consider Package management an integrated requirement for any CI/CD platform Provide seamless progressive delivery capabilities as a critical tool for enabling lean product-focused development Consolidate around Kubernetes as the de facto multi-cloud abstraction layer which application delivery teams interact with to deploy and maintain software Have adapted DevSecOps processes to also include infrastructure and observability into CI/CD pipelines providing more responsive, more secure, and higher quality production applications Themes Our Ops Section themes are additive to our overall Yearly Themes. In FY24, we plan to execute on: World-class DevSecOps by delivering GitLab Events, CI/CD Catalog, enabling GitOps in GitLab with Flux, integrating a cluster overview under Environments, and prioritizing usability of our key workflows Advanced security and compliance by delivering SLSA 4 framework requirements, investing in Secrets Management Direction Observability, analytics, & feedback via our investment in end-to-end error tracking. GitLab Data Science support with SaaS Runner GPU improvements Ops Section Plan Our plan is to continue to lean into adoption through usability and discoverability in our core stages of Verify, Package, and Deploy. This will mean sustained focus on onboarding users and organizations from SCM, to CI",

For the Analytics stage, we will pursue our common progression product approach to breadth, namely: Create MVCs which showcase the possibility of new categories in a single-application Leverage the high rate of learning provided by dogfooding to achieve viability Shift focus to awareness and acquisition of viable capabilities by increasing SMAU & GMAU Begin building completeness and tier value as a result of increased SMAU As a result our performance indicators and tier strategies are aligned to the maturity of each stage. In doing so, over the next 12 months we will choose NOT to: Invest in Verify stage features like: Tracking accessibility results over time. Merge Trains API Support. Automatic flaky test minimization. Creation and management of tests (automated or manual). Real-time pipeline and job statuses Pipeline Simulation or local pipeline debugging, even though it is a highly requested feature Invest in some specific Package stage features like: Dependency Firewall, as we'll focus on making the Dependency Proxy functional and complete. Package manager formats and features that are not NPM, Maven, C++, .NET, Linux, Ruby, Python, PHP, or Go or community contributed. Invest in specific Deploy stage features like: Service Now Integration to control rollbacks or other pipeline actions is not in the cards. Continuous Delivery for Machine Learning - Add support for training and testing pipelines for Machine Learning Invest heavily in ease of use and experience for individuals attaching Kubernetes clusters to projects. While there are use cases for project-level attachment, it is a higher priority to provide Infrastructure Platform teams with an enhanced cloud-native management experience. Invest heavily in automated cluster cost-optimization efforts - We will pursue this as our adoption by platform teams increases. Why We Do It Impact The Ops Section stages are at the forefront of GitLab's single DevOps platform vision of enabling everyone to contribute. These stages represent half of GitLab's Total Addressable Market expansion during the next five years and the markets where we have some of the lowest current penetration. As a result the opportunity and impact from R&D investment in these stages are the highest in the company. User growth in Ops Section stages improves Stages per Organization beyond typical SCM customers - providing the value of a single DevOps platform to our customers. Adding new types of users in turn increases unique active users, while adding paid tier features increases Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) and broad adoption across users in our customers' organizations increases net retention. All of these are critical drivers of our GitLab's business performance. We would appreciate your feedback on this direction page. Please take our survey, email Jackie Porter or propose an MR to this page! Market The total addressable market (TAMkt) for DevOps tools targeting these stages was $5.2B in 2019 and is expected to grow to $10.7B by 2024 (18.8% CAGR) (internal). This analysis is considered conservative as it focuses only on developers and doesn't include additional potential users. This is a deep profit pool and represents a significant portion of GitLab's expanding addressable market. As organizations further adopt DevOps, developer focused ops tools account for a larger share of market. This market has traditionally targeted IT Architects, System Admins and Operators where large hardware budgets enabled expensive IT tools to flourish. The market is well established (internal), but the participants are evolving rapidly. Existing leaders in single stages of the DevOps lifecycle are expanding to build value stream delivery platforms (internal), what GitLab calls complete DevOps platforms delivered as a single application. These existing players are doing so via acquisition and product development. The leaders run the gamut from GitHub with their strong position in the SCM market and their growing capabilities to compete in CI/CD, to Delivery focused tools such as Harness and JFrog, to Grafana, DataDog and New Relic with their strong positions in Observability and expansion into deployment and incident response. All are pivoting to pursue the value stream delivery platform market. Current Position Despite many strong players, GitLab's market share in the Ops section is growing, especially in the Verify, Package, and Deploy stages. For Analytics, our unique perspective as a single and complete DevOps application positions us for growth. You can see how users currently use our various stages in our Ops Section product performance indicators (internal) and Ops Section Usage Dashboard (internal). We are continually investing in R&D in all Ops Section stages. The maturity of each stage and category can be found in our maturity page. Our investment in the Ops section stages (internal) is critical to both enabling enterprise users to continue on their DevOps maturity journey and completing our complete DevOps platform vision. Driving adoption across multiple Ops stages enables early adopters to recognize the benefit of a single application. Challenges We face a wide range of market challenges",

Our investment in the Ops section stages (internal) is critical to both enabling enterprise users to continue on their DevOps maturity journey and completing our complete DevOps platform vision. Driving adoption across multiple Ops stages enables early adopters to recognize the benefit of a single application. Challenges We face a wide range of market challenges (in priority order): GitLab created a new market for DevOps platforms delivered as a single application. We were an early entrant in this market before it was defined but there are many, and will be more, fast followers. Key players include large established tech firms (Microsoft, Atlassian), growth companies that have established positions in specific stages (Harness, DataDog), and newly consolidated platforms from acquisition (JFrog, CollabNet/VersionOne/XebiaLabs). By 2023, the number of companies switching to VSDPs is expected to quadruple (internal). Few companies have been able to successfully bridge between Developer and Operator personas. Building tools that satisfy both sets of jobs-to-be-done is difficult. Without deeply understanding new personas (such as Platform Engineers) and tasks, market entrants' products result in a checklist of modules that lack a cohesive experience for users. In recent years we've seen the emergence of large public cloud infrastructure providers moving from a focus on infrastructure services for operators towards developer tools. These providers could challenge current notions of multi-cloud by creating great, integrated experiences in their tools for developers to create, verify, and deploy applications to the provider's infrastructure. Microsoft, with their acquisiton of GitHub and it's burgeoning preference for Azure deployments is a first example. There is a possibility that these provider-centric ecosystems present organizations with a choice of investing in a best-of-breed platform with a small subset of projects or a sufficient enough platform used by all. Beyond the key players, there is also rapid innovation. This makes for a market where there is proliferation of new technology concurrent to consolidation of the winning technologies into comprehensive platform players. Ease of deployment for CI/CD and operational tools has aided this expansion. Developers and operations teams can easily instrument and utilize new technologies alongside their existing software development pipelines with less risk, and in quicker time frames than under previous models where it required diligent planning and months of installation and configuration. The macroeconomic environment in 2023 has slowed from prior year's growth, as indicated by a recent Gartner Report on IT Spending in 2023. This poses a headwind toward all software providers and the industry as a whole could face increased pressure. Outside of market challenges we have some internal ones as well: While we are focused on it - generally we are still not dogfooding the Deploy and Analytics stage features sufficiently. Within GitLab we don't have a dedicated Platform Team that serves as our internal model for our Primary Target Persona. This has the effect of slowing our rate of learning, and putting us in the position of not having immediate real-world validation of product investments. Our Product Hierarchy means we have groups narrowly focused on stages or categories. This has the effect of limiting our ability to deliver truly delightful experiences for users. We've started tracking the Ops section's contribution to Stage Per Organization to further mitigate this challenge. Contributing to a growing, large monolith can be slower and more risky than building independent services and applications. We have seen our cycle time slowed down by long MR reviews. We have also experienced the risk of not building for scale first by introducing functionalities only to see that new service cause outages. Having a large scope means having to make more trade-offs. These trade-offs often mean divesting from further-horizon investment in favor of short term gain. Being able to stay disciplined to our investment allocation - internal will be important to penetrate new markets. Opportunities Given the above challenges, there are key opportunities we must take advantage of (in priority order): Rise of the Platform Engineer: Gartner has suggested that \"platform engineering is an emerging technology that can accelerate the delivery of applications.\" The 2022 report expects that by 2026 80% of enterpises will establish a platform team to improve developer experience and effectiveness with resuable services and tools related to delivery. GitLab is well positioned as a unified platform to deliver on the emerging platform engineering trend. Cross-Use Case Workflows: As a single DevSecOps platform, a single user may action and span multiple use cases in their daily experience with GitLab. We have an opportunity to prompt users to explore new functionality within their existing workflow. For example, we can prompt users without CI/CD on projects that contain Terraform code to utilize our Terraform MR review widget. Doing so will organically inspire more adoption and usage of cross-platform tools. This usage will result in an improvement of productivity for our users, supporting the expansion of seats to include more users within an organization's instance. DevOps Adoption Pains: For many organizations their DevOps journey is currently stalled as they attempt to adopt continuous delivery in an effort to increase their deployment frequency. GitLab's common method for defining CI and CD workflows allows organizations to use the same tools their teams love",

DevOps Adoption Pains: For many organizations their DevOps journey is currently stalled as they attempt to adopt continuous delivery in an effort to increase their deployment frequency. GitLab's common method for defining CI and CD workflows allows organizations to use the same tools their teams love for CI when overcoming this new challenge. DevOps transformations are also hampered by a lack of IT operations skills (internal). Most organizations have taken to creating infrastructure platform teams to minimize the amount of operations expertise required by DevOps team members (internal). Those teams' traditional operations tools are not integrated within the development team's workflow, and force an unneeded tradeoff between reliability and speed. This tradeoff results in increased down-time and problems with recovering from disaster - or slowed business agility. Value Stream Delivery Platforms like GitLab can move a team from reactive to proactive reliability without sacrificing development velocity (internal). GitLab's combination of Create, Verify, Deploy and Analytics allow our users to measure all four aspects of their delivery performance. Improving the resuability, standardization, and enforcement of best practices via Shared Resource Library or Service Catalog is top of mind to mitigate the DevOps implementation challenges of enterprises. Increasing Developer buying power: In the move to DevOps, tools focused on enabling developers garner an increased share of wallet. 71% of organizations (internal) will achieve full DevOps adoption on some projects within a year. 35% of DevOps implementations include Analytics stage capabilities, 30% include Deploy stage ones (internal). This increasing buyer power is driven by the cultural and organizational changes (often called Digital Transformation Initiatives) needed for DevOps to deliver software faster. This also applies to traditional IT teams who will, by 2024 see 30% of their focus move from IT ops to continuous engineering via role shifts like moving from system admin roles to SRE roles. Market Recognition: The IT market has recognized the value of GitLab's core proposition, a complete DevOps platform delivered as a single application. We know because single-function companies are consolidating, and analysts have created a new category - VSDP - to describe that proposition. One key value driver for this market is the shifting-left of traditional Ops tasks ensuring reliability doesn't have to come at the expense of speed. IaC and GitOps are strong first steps towards AIOps: AIOps strives to provide self-learning, self-healing IT operations massively impacting IT operations professionals and their tools. However, it is early in the hype cycle (internal) and being successful will depend on DevOps teams first defining their infrastructure, operations, and observability as code. IT Operations teams are first adopting automation and programmable infrastructure (Automated Ops) in order to keep up with developer velocity. Experience with developer tools like source control and CI/CD tooling are becoming requirements for operations teams, often replacing inefficient CMDB tools in the process. GitLab's roots in SCM and CI and the entire GitOps, Infrastructure as Code, and Observability as Code movements will help us attract and add value for Ops personas and set us up for future AIOps success. Continuing commoditization of tooling: Well-funded technology companies (Google, Netflix, Lyft, Spotify etc.) that are focused on scaling have a history of releasing open source software that leap-frog vendor software. Examples include Kubernetes, Prometheus, and many of the foundational projects in CNCF. In the observability space, 70% of instrumentation is expected to be open-source by 2025. DevOps vendors have to continue to move up the value chain as previously specialized software gets commoditized. GitLab has the opportunity to mind the Developer Experience Gap and provide an easy to use and effective software development toolchain. Useful Resources Below are some additional resources to learn more about Ops: The DevOps Handbook: How to Create World-Class Agility, Reliability, and Security in Technology Organizations Accelerate: The Science of DevOps: Building and Scaling High Performing Technology Organizations Performance Indicators The performance of the Ops section is defined as the total adoption of its stages as measured by the Ops Section Total Stages Monthly Active Users (internal)) (Ops Section CMAU). Ops Section TMAU is a sum of all SMAUs across the five stages in the Ops Section (Verify, Package, Deploy & Analytics). To increase the Ops Section TMAU, the product groups are focused on driving their stage adoption. We are especially focused on increasing adoption of the Verify and Deploy stages by driving CI usage from existing SCM users and driving CD usage from existing CI users.

This empowers organizations to apply repeatable, defensible processes that automate security and compliance policies that proactively reduce overall security risk. DevSecOpsPlanCodeBuildTestReleaseDeployOperateMonitorSecurityComplianceApplication Security TestingSoftware Supply Chain SecuritySecurity Risk Management Section overview The Sec section focuses on providing security and compliance visibility across the entire software development lifecycle. We accomplish this by: Shifting security testing left, enabling developers to begin security scanning as soon as they write their first line of code. Providing organizations with visibility and control over the security risk present across their environment. GitLab and the DevSecOps lifecycle GitLab is uniquely positioned to fully support DevSecOps by providing a single application for the entire software development lifecycle. This includes both shifting Application Security Testing (AST) left as well as providing visibility and control over security and compliance findings, from first line of code to production. GitLab's single application maps directly to the DevSecOps lifecycle. GitLab's AST stage focuses on pinpointing vulnerabilities and weaknesses, from development to production, while the Security Risk Management (SRM) stage provides visibility and control over the security findings AST detects. Software Supply Chain Security (SSCS) makes GitLab a verifiably secure foundation for software delivery. Together, GitLab supports all teams involved in delivering secure applications: Develop: Developers create new source code, including new features and bug fixes, and commit this code to a branch within the project. This step is supported by the Create stage of the DevOps lifecycle, providing developers with source code management, code editors, and code review workflows. Analyze: Upon code commit, AST scanners kick off automatically and identify any new security findings with the delta code change. This enables developers to stay within context, enabling them to understand the cause and effect of their code change. AST scanners leverage the Verify stage of the DevOps lifecycle to provide scanning within the CI pipeline. Mitigate: Developers are provided with the details needed to understand how to remediate the newly introduced security findings. Developers are also offered automatic remediation, where applicable. Protect: AST scanners provide continuous scanning coverage for applications deployed to production, while SRM dashboards and policies and SSCS compliance frameworks help users implement their security and compliance requirements across their organization. Lowering the cost of remediation Remediating security vulnerabilities earlier reduces risk and makes remediation cheaper. When security vulnerabilities are identified at the time of code commit, developers can understand how their newly introduced code has led to this new issue. This gives the developer a cause-and-effect enabling quicker resolution while not having the time hit of context switching. This is not true as security scanning is performed later in the software development lifecycle. New vulnerabilities may not be identified until weeks or months after they were added to the application while under development. Time is not the only savings when shifting security left. In “The Economic Impacts of Inadequate Infrastructure for Software Testing”, NIST estimated the cost of remediating software bugs at $59.5 billion/year. This is compounded when taking in the average time to remediate software bugs. In “Software Development Price Guide & Hourly Rate Comparison”, FullStack Labs estimates the average cost of a software developer at $300/hour. The following table outlines the cost to remediate software bugs at different stages of the software development lifecycle: These costs are just the start of the financial impact when the software bug is also a software vulnerability. IBM, in partnership with the Ponemon Institute, put the average cost to remediate a data breach in 2020 at $3.86 million (USD). This does not take into consideration the reputation impact to the organization. Closing the loop Having visibility into security risk in just development only provides you with half of the picture. Development and SecOps teams need to have a closed feedback loop enabling both teams to be successful. Development teams can gain insight into attacks targeting the applications they develop. This allows them to prioritize vulnerabilities correctly, enabling proactive resolutions to reduce risk. Likewise, SecOps teams can gain insight from their development counterparts, providing them with visibility into how the application works. This allows them to best apply proactive measures to mitigate attacks targeting the application until development can fix the vulnerability. Closing the loop requires close collaboration, transparency, and efficiencies that only a single platform for the entire DevOps lifecycle can provide. Shifting security left while also providing protection for applications in production within a single application empowers teams",

Groups The Sec section is made up of three stages of the DevSecOps lifecycle, along with the groups in those stages: Application Security Testing (AST) Security Risk Management (SRM) Software Supply Chain Security (SSCS) Teams and Investments Team members Team members for the Sec Section can be found in the links below: Development User Experience Product Management Quality Engineering Investments Team members can learn more about GitLab's investment into the Sec section by checking the Product Investment page in the internal handbook. Accomplishments, News, and Updates A complete list of released features can be found in the Release Feature Overview. 3 Year Section Themes Scan everything, but don't get in the way The increasing pace of modern software development demands that we push security testing further left than before, integrating it into existing workflows rather than forcing teams to adapt their processes or context-switch to separate tools. Moving security scanning directly into the IDE and pre-commit stages enables developers to catch vulnerabilities, exposed secrets, and dependency issues before they even enter the codebase, dramatically reducing remediation costs and team overhead. For this proactive approach to succeed, security tools must provide clear, actionable feedback that developers can understand without deep security expertise, including precise code locations and step-by-step remediation guidance with examples of secure coding patterns. By making security both approachable and efficient, we help organizations build a true DevSecOps culture where security becomes a natural part of every developer's daily work, transforming how organizations approach application security while significantly reducing the burden on overburdened security specialists. To achieve this theme, GitLab will pursue capabilities like: Delivering scan results at the speed of software development by offering: Real-time scanning for SAST and SCA vulnerabilities and leaked secrets. Intelligent incremental scans that avoid re-scanning parts of the application that haven't changed. Identifying runtime security issues early in the development phase with DAST unit tests and by running DAST scans in development environments like `localhost`. Integrating Secret Detection scanning across the platform to prevent leaked secrets in every written place like descriptions and comments on issues, epics, and merge requests, wikis, and more. Automatically scanning for CVEs in repositories and registries for dependencies, packages, and containers. Detecting malicious packages and prevent them from entering your software supply chain Make better risk decisions with richer context In today's complex security landscape, presenting raw vulnerability data without context can lead teams to work on less impactful tasks or accept risks without realizing the consequences. That doesn't work well for anyone. By combining multiple security scanning methods and leveraging more advanced techniques like AI and machine learning, we can provide deeper context and more accurate risk assessments for each security finding. This intelligence-driven approach helps teams cut through the noise of security alerts, focusing remediation efforts on vulnerabilities that pose the greatest actual risk to their applications. Integration across different security disciplines creates a comprehensive view of each vulnerability's impact and exploitability, enabling more confident decision-making about when and how to remediate issues. The power of machine learning transforms security scanning from a simple detection tool into an intelligent advisory system that helps teams make informed, strategic decisions about their security posture and resource allocation. To achieve this theme, GitLab will pursue capabilities like: Integrating detection capabilities across scanning disciplines to provide more actionable outcomes. Using SAST for advanced tasks like reachability analysis and API discovery, so we can enrich DAST and other scanning processes. Correlating and deduplicating scanning outputs to reduce noise, uncover the most urgent exploitable issues, and focus attention on the most impactful remediations. Leveraging AI/ML to reduce false positives by understanding normal code structure, commit history, and runtime behavior. Take action, not just inventory When tools identify vulnerabilities but don't provide a clear path to resolution, organizations end up exposed to security risks for longer than necessary. Worse still, as backlogs of security issues grow, organizations end up accepting risks without realizing it—an untriaged and unresolved vulnerability is one that's tacitly accepted. Modern security tools must go beyond detection to provide automated remediation pathways that help both developers and security teams efficiently address vulnerabilities. Developers can make larger impacts when they receive automated merge requests for dependency updates, intelligent suggestions for fixing vulnerable code, and clear guidance on implementing secure alternatives directly within their development environment. Security professionals benefit from automated workflows that can immediately revoke exposed secrets, quarantine vulnerable dependencies, and orchestrate large-scale security updates across multiple repositories without manual legwork. As applications and security threats grow more complex, effective security programs have to rely on automation to scale up. By transforming security findings into automated actions, intelligent tools help organizations dramatically reduce their mean time to remediation while allowing",

    "content": "most urgent exploitable issues, and focus attention on the most impactful remediations. Leveraging AI/ML to reduce false positives by understanding normal code structure, commit history, and runtime behavior. Take action, not just inventory When tools identify vulnerabilities but don't provide a clear path to resolution, organizations end up exposed to security risks for longer than necessary. Worse still, as backlogs of security issues grow, organizations end up accepting risks without realizing it—an untriaged and unresolved vulnerability is one that's tacitly accepted. Modern security tools must go beyond detection to provide automated remediation pathways that help both developers and security teams efficiently address vulnerabilities. Developers can make larger impacts when they receive automated merge requests for dependency updates, intelligent suggestions for fixing vulnerable code, and clear guidance on implementing secure alternatives directly within their development environment. Security professionals benefit from automated workflows that can immediately revoke exposed secrets, quarantine vulnerable dependencies, and orchestrate large-scale security updates across multiple repositories without manual legwork. As applications and security threats grow more complex, effective security programs have to rely on automation to scale up. By transforming security findings into automated actions, intelligent tools help organizations dramatically reduce their mean time to remediation while allowing both development and security teams to focus on strategic work rather than routine maintenance. To achieve this theme, GitLab will pursue capabilities like: Automating remediation actions like revoking exposed secrets, blocking insecure code, and upgrading vulnerable dependencies. Continuing to invest in GitLab Duo Vulnerability Explanation and Vulnerability Resolution to produce better recommendations. Providing automated system hardening, such as removing dependencies that are not in use. Improving AST scan results so that they are easier to understand and act on. Top-down security controls Security teams need centralized management for their security and compliance workflows. Features such as user management, compliance labels, security policies, and the vulnerability and dependency lists need to allow for centralized management that applies across all of an organization's projects. No compromises with compliance SSCS capabilities will ensure that compliance regulations are strictly followed in a way that they cannot be bypassed without the proper approvals. This includes providing the necessary tools to audit, monitor, and manage the compliance controls that are enforced. Coordinate governance across GitLab SSCS capabilities will serve as a connection point for a seamless workflow spanning across the DevSecOps lifecycle. By enabling collaboration between types of users, SSCS can help solidify the advantages GitLab has to offer as a single application. For example, these areas might include the following: Facilitating a continuous experience for scanning across repositories, registries, and production environments. Centralizing security and compliance controls across GitLab, including merge request approvals, anomalous user activity, and anomalous pipeline/job activity. Leveraging data about production environment configuration to reduce false positives in scanners. Leveraging data about vulnerabilities in development to inform and drive threat mitigation in production. Emphasize usability and convention over configuration SSCS capabilities will be pre-configured with reasonable defaults out-of-the-box whenever possible. When not possible, they will be easy to configure either through code or through a guided UI workflow that is friendly to users without coding knowledge. Regardless of how the capabilities are configured, they will be stored as code for ease of management. For example, GitLab's security policy editor supports editing policies in both a rule mode and in yaml mode. Secure the software supply chain SSCS capabilities allow organizations to lock down every aspect of their supply chain. This includes securely authenticating users into GitLab, hardening the GitLab platform itself, and verifying every step along the DevSecOps lifecycle as code is created, built, and deployed. Stages and Categories The Sec section is composed of two stages, Secure and Govern, each of which contains several categories. Each stage has an overall strategy statement below, aligned to the themes for Sec. Each category within each stage has a dedicated direction page plus optional documentation, marketing pages, and other materials linked below. Application Security Testing (AST) stage The Application Security Testing (AST) stage helps customers find vulnerabilities in applications before they reach production. We focus on developing scanning capabilities to find these vulnerabilities, then we work closely with the Security Risk Management and Software Supply Chain Security stages to ensure that organizations can take action on the vulnerabilities our scanners detect. Categories SAST Scans your application source code and binaries to spot potential vulnerabilities before deployment. SAST supports scanning a variety of different programming languages and automatically chooses the right analyzer even if your project uses more than one language. Vulnerabilities, additional data, and solutions are shown in-line with every merge request. Scanner results are collected and presented as a single report. This category is at the \"complete\" level of maturity. Priority: high • Documentation • Direction Secret Detection Scans your repository to help prevent your secrets from being exposed. Secret Detection scanning works on all text files, regardless of the language or framework used. Code pushed to a remote Git branch can be rejected if a secret is detected. This category is at the \"viable\" level of maturity. Priority: medium • Documentation • Direction Code Quality Analyzes your source code quality and complexity. This helps keep your project’s code simple, readable, and easier to maintain. This category is at the \"minimal\" level of maturity. Documentation • Direction DAST Runs automated penetration tests to find vulnerabilities in web applications and APIs as they are running.

Software Supply Chain Security (SSCS) stage The Software Supply Chain Security (SSCS) stage helps organizations to reduce their overall risk by applying appropriate management and governance oversight across the entire DevSecOps lifecycle. SSCS provides management tools to secure the GitLab platform itself by restricting access to authenticated users and ensuring they are provisioned with the least amount of required privileges. To help manage and monitor risk levels, the SSCS stage provides visibility into user permissions and activity; project dependencies; security findings; and adherence to compliance standards. This visibility is then coupled with enforcement capabilities to proactively prevent risks by automating compliance and securing the software supply chain. Categories System Access System Access provides tools to authenticate through all points of GitLab (UI, CLI, API). These tools allow you to configure what an individual/process has access to once they authenticate, determined by their role. GitLab integrates with several OmniAuth providers, LDAP, SAML, and more. Documentation • Direction Permissions GitLab provides various permissions and roles in order to evaluate what access or rights an identity should have in an environment. Custom roles can also be created to allow an organization to create user roles with the precise privileges and permissions desired.

Priority: low • Documentation • Direction Pricing SSCS is focused on providing governance and compliance features that span across the DevSecOps lifecycle. SSCS's tiering strategy aligns with the GitLab approach of selecting the tier based on who cares most about the feature. Because Executives generally care most about governance features, it is expected that most SSCS features will land in the Ultimate tier. Free This tier is the primary way to increase broad adoption of the SSCS stage, as well as encouraging community contributions and improving security across the entire GitLab user base. As a general rule of thumb, features will fall in the Free tier when they meet one or more of the following criteria: The feature is highly useful for an individual with a few small projects rather than meeting the needs of an organization or enterprise that is operating at scale. The feature is provided by an integration with an open source project rather than being natively developed by GitLab. Premium This tier is not a significant part of SSCS's pricing strategy; however, a few features features that primarily appeal to Directors rather than Executives may fall into the Premium tier. One example of this is our audit event functionality that is available in this tier. Ultimate This tier is the primary focus for the SSCS stage as most SSCS features enable executives to ensure that their organization meets compliance requirements and maintains an acceptable security posture. As a general rule of thumb, features will fall in the Ultimate tier when they meet one or more of the following criteria: The feature is focused on enabling an organization or enterprise to operate at scale rather than an individual with a few small projects.

Our goal is to become our customers' single source of truth for artifact management by 2027, replacing fragmented toolchains with a unified platform that reduces costs, improves security, and accelerates development velocity. What is Package? The Package stage is responsible for delivering a comprehensive artifact management solution that meets the needs of both small teams and enterprise organizations. Artifact management involves storing, versioning, and tracking binary files, libraries, and dependencies used in software development. It's critical for ensuring consistency, reproducibility, and efficient collaboration in development projects. Artifact management systems help manage the software artifacts' lifecycle, from creation to deployment, facilitating easy access, sharing among team members, and integration with build and deployment tools. Our differentiators While competitors like JFrog Artifactory claim to offer a \"system of record,\" GitLab Package goes beyond this by: Deep Integration with Development Workflows: Unlike standalone solutions, GitLab Package is natively integrated with your source code, CI/CD pipelines, and security scanning tools, creating a seamless experience. Enhanced Security and Compliance: GitLab's built-in security features work directly with your artifacts, providing vulnerability scanning, dependency analysis, and compliance checking without requiring separate products or integrations. Reduced Context Switching: Teams can manage code, builds, tests, and artifacts all within a single platform, eliminating the need to switch between multiple tools. Streamlined Troubleshooting: Having artifacts alongside your source code makes troubleshooting issues significantly easier, with clear build provenance and traceability. Cost and Maintenance Efficiency: Consolidate tools and reduce both licensing costs and maintenance overhead. Native Build Promotion and Complete Provenance: GitLab uses a git-native approach to build promotion through semantic versioning with commit identifiers (e.g., myapp-1.2.3-abc123f) and git tags for releases. This provides complete build provenance by linking artifacts directly to their source code, CI/CD pipelines, and deployment history within a single platform - enabling rapid troubleshooting and ensuring supply chain security compliance without separate tooling. What's next and why 2025 priorities We're expanding our enterprise capabilities to meet the needs of larger organizations: Virtual Registries for Maven and npm: We're introducing Maven virtual registries that will configure an ordered list of upstream repositories and resolve packages from these sources, caching them at the top-level group. This feature will seamlessly pull packages from external remotes into your GitLab top-level group, simplifying Maven settings file configuration and increasing the reliability of your builds. Container Registry Improvements: We're enhancing security with immutable tags and expanding on our recently launched protected tags to prevent accidental or malicious updates. Artifact Protection: We'll complete our rollout of protected packages across all supported formats, including generic packages. 2026 roadmap Expanded Virtual Registry Support: Adding support for PyPI, NuGet, RPM, and Debian. Dependency Firewall Implementation: Full rollout of features to prevent supply chain attacks. Advanced Usage Analytics: Providing insights into dependency health and usage patterns. What we aren't working on and why New Package Manager Formats: We're focusing on improving our existing formats (OCI-artifacts, npm, Maven, NuGet, PyPI, Terraform, and generic packages) rather than expanding to additional formats in the near term. This approach ensures we maintain our high standards for performance and reliability while delivering the enterprise features our customers need most. Categories Container Registry The GitLab container registry is a secure and private registry for OCI artifacts, such as Docker container images. Use GitLab CI/CD to create and publish branch/release specific images, manage them via the GitLab API, and discover them through the intuitive user interface. Package registry Our package registry supports multiple formats including npm, Maven, NuGet, PyPI, Terraform, and generic packages. We provide project and group-level private package registries and are expanding capabilities to include virtual registries. Virtual registries Virtual registries provide a mechanism for storing and accessing external packages, enabling more reliable builds. They allow you to proxy and cache dependencies from external sources, reducing build times and improving supply chain reliability. The virtual registry for container images currently allows you to proxy and cache images from DockerHub. In upcoming releases, we'll expand this feature to support multiple endpoints and additional package formats. Dependency firewall Many projects depend on packages from unknown or unverified providers, introducing potential security vulnerabilities. The dependency firewall, leveraging our virtual registries, will give security and compliance teams more control and visibility over the packages being used. Helpful links Maturity plan Issue list Overall vision Research issues Customer needs As the PM for the Package stage, I hear regularly from customers and prospects that would like to migrate off of JFrog's Artifactory. Their reasons for wanting to consolidate on GitLab are: Convenience (authentication, management, improved UX) Cost Better support and access to product teams The needs of these customers can be predictably segmented by the size of their organization: Non-enterprise Organizations Typically they'd like to know if we",

    "content": "project and group-level private package registries and are expanding capabilities to include virtual registries. Virtual registries Virtual registries provide a mechanism for storing and accessing external packages, enabling more reliable builds. They allow you to proxy and cache dependencies from external sources, reducing build times and improving supply chain reliability. The virtual registry for container images currently allows you to proxy and cache images from DockerHub. In upcoming releases, we'll expand this feature to support multiple endpoints and additional package formats. Dependency firewall Many projects depend on packages from unknown or unverified providers, introducing potential security vulnerabilities. The dependency firewall, leveraging our virtual registries, will give security and compliance teams more control and visibility over the packages being used. Helpful links Maturity plan Issue list Overall vision Research issues Customer needs As the PM for the Package stage, I hear regularly from customers and prospects that would like to migrate off of JFrog's Artifactory. Their reasons for wanting to consolidate on GitLab are: Convenience (authentication, management, improved UX) Cost Better support and access to product teams The needs of these customers can be predictably segmented by the size of their organization: Non-enterprise Organizations Typically they'd like to know if we support format x and if not when we will support it. If we support their requested format, these customers are often able to consolidate quickly. Enterprise organizations Enterprise organizations frequently express interest in consolidating on GitLab but are waiting for our Package product to mature. The key features they're waiting for include: Virtual registries for managing upstream repositories Dependency firewall to prevent supply chain attacks Improved discoverability and visibility into dependency usage We're addressing these needs directly in our 2025-2027 roadmap. GitLab Package - Market Analysis Competitive landscape GitLab Package operates in a market dominated by established players like JFrog Artifactory and Sonatype Nexus, with cloud providers (AWS, Azure, Google) and other DevOps platforms (GitHub) offering varying levels of functionality. Key market trends Consolidation of DevOps Toolchains: Organizations are seeking to reduce tool sprawl by consolidating functionality into fewer platforms Supply Chain Security: Increasing focus on securing the software supply chain from vulnerabilities and attacks Integration with CI/CD: Demand for artifact management that integrates seamlessly with build and deployment processes Enterprise Scalability: Need for solutions that can handle the volume and complexity of enterprise-level package management Product comparison Note: This comparison focuses on dedicated DevOps platforms and artifact management solutions. Cloud-native registries (AWS ECR/CodeArtifact, Azure ACR, Google Artifact Registry) serve different use cases and are typically chosen as part of broader cloud platform strategies rather than as standalone artifact management solutions.

This integration reduces context switching, simplifies workflows, and provides a unified experience across the software development lifecycle. Native integration with GitLab CI/CD The tight integration with GitLab CI/CD means that packages can be built, tested, and published as part of the same pipeline without additional configuration or plugins. This simplifies setup and reduces maintenance overhead. Built-in security scanning and compliance GitLab's integrated security features work directly with your artifacts, providing vulnerability scanning, dependency analysis, and compliance checking without requiring separate products or integrations. Improved troubleshooting and traceability Having artifacts alongside your source code makes troubleshooting issues significantly easier, with clear build provenance and traceability from code to deployment. Cost and maintenance efficiency By consolidating tools, organizations can reduce both licensing costs and the overhead of maintaining multiple systems.

Please use #doe-ops or other public channels for topics that don’t require confidentiality. Meetings Zoom Recordings synced to Google Drive GitLab encourages transparency by default, and when meetings are recorded, they can be automatically synced to Google Drive as highlighted in the section about how we conduct video calls at GitLab. To summarize: Record meetings to the cloud in Zoom, and add the text [REC] anywhere in the meeting title (e.g. Google calendar event) It will automatically be added to the GitLab Videos Recorded folder on Google Drive, with a naming convention of youremail-Meeting Title. After a meeting ends, Zoom may take some time to process the recording before it is actually available. The sync to Google Drive happens on the hour mark, so if the recording is not available, it may take another hour to be transferred. Future recordings of recurring meetings can be found in the same folder youremail-Meeting Title, even if alternate hosts start the recording. Ops Engineering Showcase Starting in 2023 in FY24-Q1, a fresh new format for this showcase will include the recording and sharing of videos that team members have created. Once a video has been created, an async discussion issue should be created using this template and listed under the relevant quarterly epic. Based on the amount of questions being discussed in the issue, an AMA may be set up to discuss further in a group setting. Like before, these videos are intended to be opportunities for engineers to show off the things they’ve been working on. Beginning in March 2023 all Ops teams are required to provide at least one showcase video and async discussion issue per month. We require participation in this process because it helps reinforce our values of Results, Transparency, and Iteration. In addition, these showcases are valuable in helping team members across the company better understand the progress and obstacles across the many product areas Ops team members are focused on. They are also fun to watch. These videos will be reviewed monthly by the Director of Engineering and other leaders in the group. The team’s Engineering Manager is the DRI for submitting the showcase, though in many cases the demo may be delegated to another member of the team. Team members are encouraged to use these videos to transparently showcase the current state of their projects. It is not encouraged to spend significant time prepping for these demos or only showcase finished, polished functionality; showing functionality in an incomplete state is encouraged. Videos may be specifically recorded for this purpose or be excerpts from team meetings, etc. Some suggested ideas to consider could be related to error budget improvements, performance improvements to current features, refactoring to codebase for future maintainability, etc. Ops Engineering Showcases Recordings Past Recordings Quarterly Recordings NOTE: - changed to monthly recordings in FY24-Q3.

The intent is to inspire creativity and encourage collaboration amongst those you may not have the opportunity to work with on a regular basis, set aside regular milestone deliverables, and have some fun with tackling different challenges. With the IT landscape rapidly changing with explorations in emerging technologies, having Hackathons take place twice a year offers everyone a chance to contribute to different areas of interest. Planning Processes Planning processes followed by teams in the Sub-department: General Ops Sub-department Planning Process Forced Priority planning/scheduling Our prioritization framework describes a number of Forced Priority labels that present a high risk to our customers and our business. As such, it’s critical that we complete this work within the appropriate SLO/SLAs where possible. An example of this are security issues, here’s a dashboard for past due and soon to be due security issues: https://10az.online.tableau.com/t/gitlab/views/DRAFTIssueTypesDetail/PastDueIssueList/d1401498-2050-4321-b0f4-ab51047fbeb1/1909fa14-fdf0-4682-8a07-f02d8c8d4803 With this in mind, here’s a process that groups are encouraged to use and iterate on in the event that they don’t have an existing approach or are falling behind on SLA/SLOs.

    "content": "to experiment with working on ideas as possible features that can be integrated into GitLab in the future. The intent is to inspire creativity and encourage collaboration amongst those you may not have the opportunity to work with on a regular basis, set aside regular milestone deliverables, and have some fun with tackling different challenges. With the IT landscape rapidly changing with explorations in emerging technologies, having Hackathons take place twice a year offers everyone a chance to contribute to different areas of interest. Planning Processes Planning processes followed by teams in the Sub-department: General Ops Sub-department Planning Process Forced Priority planning/scheduling Our prioritization framework describes a number of Forced Priority labels that present a high risk to our customers and our business. As such, it’s critical that we complete this work within the appropriate SLO/SLAs where possible. An example of this are security issues, here’s a dashboard for past due and soon to be due security issues: https://10az.online.tableau.com/t/gitlab/views/DRAFTIssueTypesDetail/PastDueIssueList/d1401498-2050-4321-b0f4-ab51047fbeb1/1909fa14-fdf0-4682-8a07-f02d8c8d4803 With this in mind, here’s a process that groups are encouraged to use and iterate on in the event that they don’t have an existing approach or are falling behind on SLA/SLOs. To be clear, this is not a required process, if your group’s approach is working, please continue with that! Ownership of scheduling forced priority work falls on our whole team, not a particular person. When forced priority issues are assigned to your group, schedule those issues right away regardless of severity label Have the team review the issue to make sure there’s a viable solution and plan (weight the issue) Have someone in the group assign themselves to work on the issue Update the issue regularly with progress Treat blockers with the same or higher priority than the original issue Sustaining / Non-Sustaining planning exercise In FY23, each EM in Ops was asked to participate in a capacity planning exercise that involved evaluating the sustaining vs non-sustaining work in their team’s backlog. This exercise was also repeated by the Verify Pipeline teams in FY24 to better understand Engineering capacity needs for each of the Pipeline teams. Each team created a staffing justification based on the breakdown of sustaining vs non-sustaining issues in their backlog. EMs estimated the number of backend engineers and frontend engineers that would be needed, per quarter, of the given fiscal year to burndown these issues, as ordered by the prioritization framework and relevant priority/severity labels. Sustaining work Sustaining work refers to the most important security, availability, scalability and performance, essential for “keeping the lights on” for the feature categories the team supports. Capacity planning for sustaining work was based on meeting the SLO/SLAs of these types of issues. The labels for sustaining work include, but are not limited to: bug::vulnerability (note: specifically this label, as an issue with only a security label does not make it a security vulnerability) bug::availability bug::performance infradev Non-Sustaining work Non-sustaining effort refers to all other work the teams would work on, including: type::feature type::maintenance (e.g. technical debt that does not impact availability, scalability, performance, etc) all other type::bug issues not covered as sustaining work reviewing community contributions responding to customer inquiries / support requests Ops Promotion Process Tips for writing Promotion Documents The format and guidelines are as listed in this Google Doc template Results is our most important value to cover in promotion docs, especially at Staff+ levels. This should be short (making it succinct can be easier to understand), but descriptive enough to show the impact these results have had. Impact should also be highlighted (quantifiable where possible), with examples such as: customer-facing impact (CMAU, ARR growth, retention, adoption, etc) improvements in efficiency, team process or other team metrics Examples demonstrating leadership, ownership and accountability (going above and beyond for your current role): Your role on a project or initiative (“how did you successfully help deliver X?”, “what role did you play in this Working Group?”) MR Review efforts (your role as a maintainer for your team or for the rest of the department in your domain) Collaborating with your team’s stable counterparts Mentoring/coaching others on your team or outside your team (e.g. participation in mentorship programs, coaching in MRs as a reviewer/maintainer) Influencing your team’s technical direction or contributions to more strategic discussions For Staff+ engineers: this could mean authoring or contributing to architectural design documents or leading technical discussions with your team or driving cross-stage collaboration Involvement in recruiting efforts (e.g. as an interviewer and/or reviewer of the technical assessment) Examples of promotion documents from previously approved Ops promotions can be found in this Google Drive folder Promotion Document Reviews Team Member and Manager work together to create promotion document. Promotion document is shared with Ops Sub-Department managers in #ops-staff-confidential channel (private to Ops Managers, Senior Managers, Director) to receive feedback on the document content and how it calibrates with others in the Sub-Department. This can be done early and often. Manager requests another Manager in the Sub-Department review and approve the document. Manager requests Senior Manager in the Sub-Department review and approve the document. Manager requests Director add Team Member to list of Sub-Department planned promotions. If the team member cannot be added Director will provide feedback to Manager as to why. Director presents promotion doc at Development Department quarterly promotion review meeting. If the promotion is not approved Director will provide feedback to Manager as to why. Quarterly Promotion Review Meeting Ops Managers, Sr. Managers, and Directors meet in the last month of each quarter to: Review promotion projections for each group. Managers add a list of their direct reports who they anticipate will be ready for promotion in the next 3 quarters to the meeting agenda. Note these lists may change and are not a guarantee a team member will be promoted in a specific quarter. The lists are used for planning purposes, to help us anticipate the number of team members approaching promotion, budget impact, and to support calibration across the group. These lists should include: Team Member name Targeted promotion quarter",

These lists should include: Team Member name Targeted promotion quarter Link to promotion doc Whether the doc has received any Ops Manager or Ops Senior Manager approvals. Review Ops team member promotion docs planned to be presented at Development Department quarterly promotion review meeting. Promotion Mentor for Staff+ Roles Team members who aspire to advance within our organization are advised to identify a mentor in the targeted role, and reach out to them about a mentorship. Involving a mentor in the peer promotion review process is beneficial, as it ensures: The feedback is informed by comprehensive understanding and relevance to the individual’s development. The feedback, being familiar and constructive, will not catch the mentee off guard and will provide clear directions for improvement from peers they’d work with directly. Individuals pursuing promotion, possibly in consultation with their managers, should maintain regular communication with their mentor to evaluate progress and explore further opportunities for growth. This initiative also aims to cultivate leadership qualities among our senior Staff+ engineers. We plan to trial this optional process in Ops during Q1FY25. Progress and established mentor/mentee pairs can be found in this epic Ops Hiring process We have limited capacity in the recruiting team so hiring managers are experimenting with the Ops Hiring process. We also hold a weekly hiring manager sync meeting (see Meetings section). Objectives & Key Results (OKRs) Creating OKRs Target a 70% completion rate for OKRs so that we are setting goals ambitiously. They should be challenging enough that accomplishing 100% is a stretch goal,since GitLab considers OKRs to be stretch goals by default. If your OKRs are associated with any specific types of issues, consider reviewing the prioritization framework, and align with your team on your OKRs priority relative to one another (for example, OKRs with issues with “forced prioritization”) and be clear on planning of the associated work over the quarter. Ensure Key Results (KRs) are measurable, by specifying a number (% or unit) as the target. Be clear on the starting number, and the expected end result (e.g. from x to y). Ideally create no more than 9 KRs per quarter, ideally with approximately 3 KR per objective. Tracking and completing OKRs Tracking quarterly OKRs for Ops Engineering groups. DRIs are expected to score OKRs on a regular basis, at least monthly, if possible. At the end of the quarter, DRIs can add a retrospective as a comment to reflect on the progress of their KR, in the following format: **Good** - Things that went well... **Bad** - Things that didn't go so well... **Try** - What might you do differently next time?

Week of Jan 11th Chart data reflects live information, and is functional in Slack chart. Additional chart type shows in Slack room, with most basic visual design. We've shown to at least one alpha customer for feedback. We start sharing with them every week from here on out. Jessica is on-call and doing interrupt-driven work for week. Week of Jan 18th Most important feedback from alpha customers incorporated. Other work is prioritized to future milestones. Last chart type added. Week of Jan 25th Holiday Jan 26th.

    "content": "are listed as key projects should create these project planning artifacts: Project Plan in the handbook under /engineering/devops/ops/project-plans/<project_name>/index.html.md.erb Since the project plan is stored in the handbook it is easy to track changes in the project plan and see how it evolves over time. Project plans should (roughly) follow this format (from https://www.rubick.com/weekly-project-plans/): Weekly project plan template Week of Jan 4th Single chart shows up in Slack. Data is canned. Schedule risk: we're validating our list of chart types are all technically feasible. We'll demo outcome of that investigation. Week of Jan 11th Chart data reflects live information, and is functional in Slack chart. Additional chart type shows in Slack room, with most basic visual design. We've shown to at least one alpha customer for feedback. We start sharing with them every week from here on out. Jessica is on-call and doing interrupt-driven work for week. Week of Jan 18th Most important feedback from alpha customers incorporated. Other work is prioritized to future milestones. Last chart type added. Week of Jan 25th Holiday Jan 26th. Charts look great and are thoroughly tested, instrumented. We'll show usage dashboards. Release end of week. Updates to the plan should be made weekly, marking weekly items done and making updates based on current information. Authors should merge updates to their project plans without review/approval. We expect the use of project plans to reduce the amount of EM reporting by serving as a SSOT for project execution planning. For example this info no longer needs to be included in async updates (replace with a link to project plan). Key Project Review Meetings We hold periodic sync meetings to review key projects and collaborate on the plans for these important deliverables. Key Project DRIs should prepare for the meeting by creating a Key Project Review Prep Issue. This should be completed and shared at least 48 hours in advance of the meeting to allow time for other team members to review the content. The objective is to keep these meetings focused on execution, technical planning, and accountability within the Engineering group. These are open to anyone who wishes to attend. When it’s necessary to involve a broader group in some cases, we can plan additional follow ups case by case. We aim to meet synchronously where possible given the benefits of being able to talk through the project in a higher bandwidth context. Rescheduling is preferred if the proposed dates are not feasible for attendees. We could re-evaluate whether we can achieve the same goals with async after we have more experience running the process. The focus of the meeting time will be on topics such as: Do we all understand the goals, plan, and timeline? Obstacles/risks and mitigation plans Unmet dependencies Staffing levels Competing priorities How to unblock and/or accelerate Recognizing progress and key team member contributions Async Updates (No Status In Meetings) We have a policy in Ops to keep status updates out of meetings. Instead of reporting on status in meetings Directors, Senior Engineering Managers, Engineering Managers and Principal Engineers provide regular async updates. The content of these updates varies by individual and role: Async Update Guidance Engineering Manager Cadence: Weekly to Monthly (Optional) Topics: Highlights & Accomplishments Team Projects & Priorities (progress, blockers, key decisions, etc.) What’s next - what to expect in next update Senior Engineering Manager Cadence: Monthly (Optional) Topics: Milestone Review Allocation of focus in milestone plans (major features, maintenance, etc.) What tradeoffs or decisions should be made prior to Milestone kickoff? For example: Is the team overcommitted? Does the allocation of effort need to shift to meet specific goals? (e.g. Security SLAs) Principal Engineer Cadence: Weekly (Optional) Topics: Highlights & Accomplishments Projects & Priorities (progress, blockers, key decisions, etc.) To create a weekly async update Create a GitLab issue in any project. Apply the label ~OpsSection::AsyncUpdate. (The label ~OpsSection::Weekly-Update can also be used for backwards compatibility reasons.) Choose a descriptive title. Include your update in the issue description. To HIGHLIGHT an item for broader sharing Begin any paragraph in your update with the text HIGHLIGHT: These paragraphs will automatically be copied into the Highlights & Accomplishments section of the monthly Director’s update. To review Ops weekly async updates All issues with the ~OpsSection::AsyncUpdate or ~OpsSection::Weekly-Update label are summarized in weekly issues in the Ops Status Updates project. All team members are encouraged to comment and ask questions in weekly async update issues. This provides useful feedback to the author and opportunities to collaborate. Director reviews all updates weekly (from the prior week) and provides feedback. Senior EMs reviews all updates from their teams weekly (from the prior week) and provides feedback. Benefits of reporting and reviewing status async vs. synchronously in meetings Collaboration - By sharing announcements, achievements, goals, and plans we are empowering team members with the information they need to make sound decisions and succeed in their roles. Results - Async updates provide an important channel for sharing accomplishments and progress. Efficiency - Expecting each team member to poll for the status they need is extremely inefficient and becomes more inefficient as the organization grows. By using a Publish Subscribe model we are able to share information much more efficiently. Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging - Async status is more inclusive of team members across timezones. Not every team member will be able to make a sync meeting (due to timezone or other factors) but everyone can participate in an async update. Iteration - Taking the time to checkpoint where we are at each week prompts the author and readers to consider ways to iterate and to reflect on incremental progress. Transparency - Sharing information in a consistent, accessible way increases transparency and reduces the threshold for team members to contribute. Escalations from Support Team We are piloting a process to make coordinating with the Support team on customer escalations more efficient.

Supporting Customers on Dedicated instances When teams are asked to triage support requests for customers on GitLab Dedicated and engineers need access to their logs, a sync can be arranged between the engineer and the assigned Support Engineer for a screen sharing session. However, when further troubleshooting is needed by the engineering team or async collaboration is preferred, follow these steps to request access: Create an access request (AR) and list the engineers who require access. (Note that EMs can create this issue and provide Manager Approval on behalf of the engineers) Assign the AR to the EM and PM of the Dedicated group for read-only log access. Reference the AR issue in the support tracker issue so that the Support Engineer is aware.

Please use #doe-ops or other public channels for topics that don’t require confidentiality. Meetings Zoom Recordings synced to Google Drive GitLab encourages transparency by default, and when meetings are recorded, they can be automatically synced to Google Drive as highlighted in the section about how we conduct video calls at GitLab. To summarize: Record meetings to the cloud in Zoom, and add the text [REC] anywhere in the meeting title (e.g. Google calendar event) It will automatically be added to the GitLab Videos Recorded folder on Google Drive, with a naming convention of youremail-Meeting Title. After a meeting ends, Zoom may take some time to process the recording before it is actually available. The sync to Google Drive happens on the hour mark, so if the recording is not available, it may take another hour to be transferred. Future recordings of recurring meetings can be found in the same folder youremail-Meeting Title, even if alternate hosts start the recording. Ops Engineering Showcase Starting in 2023 in FY24-Q1, a fresh new format for this showcase will include the recording and sharing of videos that team members have created. Once a video has been created, an async discussion issue should be created using this template and listed under the relevant quarterly epic. Based on the amount of questions being discussed in the issue, an AMA may be set up to discuss further in a group setting. Like before, these videos are intended to be opportunities for engineers to show off the things they’ve been working on. Beginning in March 2023 all Ops teams are required to provide at least one showcase video and async discussion issue per month. We require participation in this process because it helps reinforce our values of Results, Transparency, and Iteration. In addition, these showcases are valuable in helping team members across the company better understand the progress and obstacles across the many product areas Ops team members are focused on. They are also fun to watch. These videos will be reviewed monthly by the Director of Engineering and other leaders in the group. The team’s Engineering Manager is the DRI for submitting the showcase, though in many cases the demo may be delegated to another member of the team. Team members are encouraged to use these videos to transparently showcase the current state of their projects. It is not encouraged to spend significant time prepping for these demos or only showcase finished, polished functionality; showing functionality in an incomplete state is encouraged. Videos may be specifically recorded for this purpose or be excerpts from team meetings, etc. Some suggested ideas to consider could be related to error budget improvements, performance improvements to current features, refactoring to codebase for future maintainability, etc. Ops Engineering Showcases Recordings Past Recordings Quarterly Recordings NOTE: - changed to monthly recordings in FY24-Q3.

Planning Processes Planning processes followed by teams in the Sub-department: General Ops Sub-department Planning Process Forced Priority planning/scheduling Our prioritization framework describes a number of Forced Priority labels that present a high risk to our customers and our business. As such, it’s critical that we complete this work within the appropriate SLO/SLAs where possible. An example of this are security issues, here’s a dashboard for past due and soon to be due security issues: https://10az.online.tableau.com/t/gitlab/views/DRAFTIssueTypesDetail/PastDueIssueList/d1401498-2050-4321-b0f4-ab51047fbeb1/1909fa14-fdf0-4682-8a07-f02d8c8d4803 With this in mind, here’s a process that groups are encouraged to use and iterate on in the event that they don’t have an existing approach or are falling behind on SLA/SLOs. To be clear, this is not a required process, if your group’s approach is working, please continue with that! Ownership of scheduling forced priority work falls on our whole team, not a particular person. When forced priority issues are assigned to your group, schedule those issues right away regardless of severity label Have the team review the issue to make sure there’s a viable solution and plan (weight the issue) Have someone in the group assign themselves to work on the issue Update the issue regularly with progress Treat blockers with the same or higher priority than the original issue Sustaining / Non-Sustaining planning exercise In FY23, each EM in Ops was asked to participate in a capacity planning exercise that involved evaluating the sustaining vs non-sustaining work in their team’s backlog. This exercise was also repeated by the Verify Pipeline teams in FY24 to better understand Engineering capacity needs for each of the Pipeline teams. Each team created a staffing justification based on the breakdown of sustaining vs non-sustaining issues in their backlog. EMs estimated the number of backend engineers and frontend engineers that would be needed, per quarter, of the given fiscal year to burndown these issues, as ordered by the prioritization framework and relevant priority/severity labels. Sustaining work Sustaining work refers to the most important security, availability, scalability and performance, essential for “keeping the lights on” for the feature categories the team supports. Capacity planning for sustaining work was based on meeting the SLO/SLAs of these types of issues. The labels for sustaining work include, but are not limited to: bug::vulnerability (note: specifically this label, as an issue with only a security label does not make it a security vulnerability) bug::availability bug::performance infradev Non-Sustaining work Non-sustaining effort refers to all other work the teams would work on, including: type::feature type::maintenance (e.g. technical debt that does not impact availability, scalability, performance, etc) all other type::bug issues not covered as sustaining work reviewing community contributions responding to customer inquiries / support requests Ops Promotion Process Tips for writing Promotion Documents The format and guidelines are as listed in this Google Doc template Results is our most important value to cover in promotion docs, especially at Staff+ levels. This should be short (making it succinct can be easier to understand), but descriptive enough to show the impact these results have had. Impact should also be highlighted (quantifiable where possible), with examples such as: customer-facing impact (CMAU, ARR growth, retention, adoption, etc) improvements in efficiency, team process or other team metrics Examples demonstrating leadership, ownership and accountability (going above and beyond for your current role): Your role on a project or initiative (“how did you successfully help deliver X?”, “what role did you play in this Working Group?”) MR Review efforts (your role as a maintainer for your team or for the rest of the department in your domain) Collaborating with your team’s stable counterparts Mentoring/coaching others on your team or outside your team (e.g. participation in mentorship programs, coaching in MRs as a reviewer/maintainer) Influencing your team’s technical direction or contributions to more strategic discussions For Staff+ engineers: this could mean authoring or contributing to architectural design documents or leading technical discussions with your team or driving cross-stage collaboration Involvement in recruiting efforts (e.g. as an interviewer and/or reviewer of the technical assessment) Examples of promotion documents from previously approved Ops promotions can be found in this Google Drive folder Promotion Document Reviews Team Member and Manager work together to create promotion document. Promotion document is shared with Ops Sub-Department managers in #ops-staff-confidential channel (private to Ops Managers, Senior Managers, Director) to receive feedback on the document content and how it calibrates with others in the Sub-Department. This can be done early and often. Manager requests another Manager in the Sub-Department review and approve the document. Manager requests Senior Manager in the Sub-Department review and approve the document. Manager requests Director add Team Member to list of Sub-Department planned promotions. If the team member cannot be added Director will provide feedback to Manager as to why. Director presents promotion doc at Development Department quarterly promotion review meeting. If the promotion is not approved Director will provide feedback to Manager as to why. Quarterly Promotion Review Meeting Ops Managers, Sr. Managers, and Directors meet in the last month of each quarter to: Review promotion projections for each group. Managers add a list of their direct reports who they anticipate will be ready for promotion in the next 3 quarters to the meeting agenda. Note these lists may change and are not a guarantee a team member will be promoted in a specific quarter. The lists are used for planning purposes, to help us anticipate the number of team members approaching promotion, budget impact, and to support calibration across the group. These lists should include: Team Member name Targeted promotion quarter",

Manager requests Senior Manager in the Sub-Department review and approve the document. Manager requests Director add Team Member to list of Sub-Department planned promotions. If the team member cannot be added Director will provide feedback to Manager as to why. Director presents promotion doc at Development Department quarterly promotion review meeting. If the promotion is not approved Director will provide feedback to Manager as to why. Quarterly Promotion Review Meeting Ops Managers, Sr. Managers, and Directors meet in the last month of each quarter to: Review promotion projections for each group. Managers add a list of their direct reports who they anticipate will be ready for promotion in the next 3 quarters to the meeting agenda. Note these lists may change and are not a guarantee a team member will be promoted in a specific quarter. The lists are used for planning purposes, to help us anticipate the number of team members approaching promotion, budget impact, and to support calibration across the group. These lists should include: Team Member name Targeted promotion quarter Link to promotion doc Whether the doc has received any Ops Manager or Ops Senior Manager approvals. Review Ops team member promotion docs planned to be presented at Development Department quarterly promotion review meeting. Promotion Mentor for Staff+ Roles Team members who aspire to advance within our organization are advised to identify a mentor in the targeted role, and reach out to them about a mentorship. Involving a mentor in the peer promotion review process is beneficial, as it ensures: The feedback is informed by comprehensive understanding and relevance to the individual’s development. The feedback, being familiar and constructive, will not catch the mentee off guard and will provide clear directions for improvement from peers they’d work with directly. Individuals pursuing promotion, possibly in consultation with their managers, should maintain regular communication with their mentor to evaluate progress and explore further opportunities for growth. This initiative also aims to cultivate leadership qualities among our senior Staff+ engineers. We plan to trial this optional process in Ops during Q1FY25. Progress and established mentor/mentee pairs can be found in this epic Ops Hiring process We have limited capacity in the recruiting team so hiring managers are experimenting with the Ops Hiring process. We also hold a weekly hiring manager sync meeting (see Meetings section). Objectives & Key Results (OKRs) Creating OKRs Target a 70% completion rate for OKRs so that we are setting goals ambitiously. They should be challenging enough that accomplishing 100% is a stretch goal,since GitLab considers OKRs to be stretch goals by default. If your OKRs are associated with any specific types of issues, consider reviewing the prioritization framework, and align with your team on your OKRs priority relative to one another (for example, OKRs with issues with “forced prioritization”) and be clear on planning of the associated work over the quarter. Ensure Key Results (KRs) are measurable, by specifying a number (% or unit) as the target. Be clear on the starting number, and the expected end result (e.g. from x to y). Ideally create no more than 9 KRs per quarter, ideally with approximately 3 KR per objective. Tracking and completing OKRs Tracking quarterly OKRs for Ops Engineering groups. DRIs are expected to score OKRs on a regular basis, at least monthly, if possible. At the end of the quarter, DRIs can add a retrospective as a comment to reflect on the progress of their KR, in the following format: **Good** - Things that went well... **Bad** - Things that didn't go so well... **Try** - What might you do differently next time? Key Projects For projects that span many milestones we are experimenting with additional project management processes.

Charts look great and are thoroughly tested, instrumented. We'll show usage dashboards. Release end of week. Updates to the plan should be made weekly, marking weekly items done and making updates based on current information. Authors should merge updates to their project plans without review/approval. We expect the use of project plans to reduce the amount of EM reporting by serving as a SSOT for project execution planning. For example this info no longer needs to be included in async updates (replace with a link to project plan). Key Project Review Meetings We hold periodic sync meetings to review key projects and collaborate on the plans for these important deliverables. Key Project DRIs should prepare for the meeting by creating a Key Project Review Prep Issue. This should be completed and shared at least 48 hours in advance of the meeting to allow time for other team members to review the content. The objective is to keep these meetings focused on execution, technical planning, and accountability within the Engineering group. These are open to anyone who wishes to attend. When it’s necessary to involve a broader group in some cases, we can plan additional follow ups case by case. We aim to meet synchronously where possible given the benefits of being able to talk through the project in a higher bandwidth context. Rescheduling is preferred if the proposed dates are not feasible for attendees. We could re-evaluate whether we can achieve the same goals with async after we have more experience running the process. The focus of the meeting time will be on topics such as: Do we all understand the goals, plan, and timeline? Obstacles/risks and mitigation plans Unmet dependencies Staffing levels Competing priorities How to unblock and/or accelerate Recognizing progress and key team member contributions Async Updates (No Status In Meetings) We have a policy in Ops to keep status updates out of meetings. Instead of reporting on status in meetings Directors, Senior Engineering Managers, Engineering Managers and Principal Engineers provide regular async updates. The content of these updates varies by individual and role: Async Update Guidance Engineering Manager Cadence: Weekly to Monthly (Optional) Topics: Highlights & Accomplishments Team Projects & Priorities (progress, blockers, key decisions, etc.) What’s next - what to expect in next update Senior Engineering Manager Cadence: Monthly (Optional) Topics: Milestone Review Allocation of focus in milestone plans (major features, maintenance, etc.) What tradeoffs or decisions should be made prior to Milestone kickoff? For example: Is the team overcommitted? Does the allocation of effort need to shift to meet specific goals? (e.g. Security SLAs) Principal Engineer Cadence: Weekly (Optional) Topics: Highlights & Accomplishments Projects & Priorities (progress, blockers, key decisions, etc.) To create a weekly async update Create a GitLab issue in any project. Apply the label ~OpsSection::AsyncUpdate. (The label ~OpsSection::Weekly-Update can also be used for backwards compatibility reasons.) Choose a descriptive title. Include your update in the issue description. To HIGHLIGHT an item for broader sharing Begin any paragraph in your update with the text HIGHLIGHT: These paragraphs will automatically be copied into the Highlights & Accomplishments section of the monthly Director’s update. To review Ops weekly async updates All issues with the ~OpsSection::AsyncUpdate or ~OpsSection::Weekly-Update label are summarized in weekly issues in the Ops Status Updates project. All team members are encouraged to comment and ask questions in weekly async update issues. This provides useful feedback to the author and opportunities to collaborate. Director reviews all updates weekly (from the prior week) and provides feedback. Senior EMs reviews all updates from their teams weekly (from the prior week) and provides feedback. Benefits of reporting and reviewing status async vs. synchronously in meetings Collaboration - By sharing announcements, achievements, goals, and plans we are empowering team members with the information they need to make sound decisions and succeed in their roles. Results - Async updates provide an important channel for sharing accomplishments and progress. Efficiency - Expecting each team member to poll for the status they need is extremely inefficient and becomes more inefficient as the organization grows. By using a Publish Subscribe model we are able to share information much more efficiently. Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging - Async status is more inclusive of team members across timezones. Not every team member will be able to make a sync meeting (due to timezone or other factors) but everyone can participate in an async update. Iteration - Taking the time to checkpoint where we are at each week prompts the author and readers to consider ways to iterate and to reflect on incremental progress. Transparency - Sharing information in a consistent, accessible way increases transparency and reduces the threshold for team members to contribute. Escalations from Support Team We are piloting a process to make coordinating with the Support team on customer escalations more efficient. See How to Use GitLab.com to Formally Request Help from the GitLab Ops Development Team for process details. If you encounter an Ops-related customer escalation,",

    "content": "information they need to make sound decisions and succeed in their roles. Results - Async updates provide an important channel for sharing accomplishments and progress. Efficiency - Expecting each team member to poll for the status they need is extremely inefficient and becomes more inefficient as the organization grows. By using a Publish Subscribe model we are able to share information much more efficiently. Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging - Async status is more inclusive of team members across timezones. Not every team member will be able to make a sync meeting (due to timezone or other factors) but everyone can participate in an async update. Iteration - Taking the time to checkpoint where we are at each week prompts the author and readers to consider ways to iterate and to reflect on incremental progress. Transparency - Sharing information in a consistent, accessible way increases transparency and reduces the threshold for team members to contribute. Escalations from Support Team We are piloting a process to make coordinating with the Support team on customer escalations more efficient. See How to Use GitLab.com to Formally Request Help from the GitLab Ops Development Team for process details. If you encounter an Ops-related customer escalation, that seems to have a high customer priority, and would benefit from additional visibility, please post a link with a short description in #doe-ops Slack channel. Supporting Customers on Dedicated instances When teams are asked to triage support requests for customers on GitLab Dedicated and engineers need access to their logs, a sync can be arranged between the engineer and the assigned Support Engineer for a screen sharing session. However, when further troubleshooting is needed by the engineering team or async collaboration is preferred, follow these steps to request access: Create an access request (AR) and list the engineers who require access. (Note that EMs can create this issue and provide Manager Approval on behalf of the engineers) Assign the AR to the EM and PM of the Dedicated group for read-only log access. Reference the AR issue in the support tracker issue so that the Support Engineer is aware.

    "content": "Ops Sub-department The Ops Sub-department is composed of development teams working on Verify, Package, Deploy, and Monitor features of GitLab DevOps Platform. The Ops Sub-department is composed of development teams working on Verify, Package, Deploy, Sevice Management and Observability features of GitLab DevOps Platform. Teams and Handbook Pages The following teams comprise the Ops sub-department: Verify stage - handbook Pipeline Execution - handbook, jtbd Pipeline Authoring - handbook, jtbd Runner - handbook, jtbd CI Platform - handbook Package stage - handbook, jtbd Container Registry - handbook Package Registry - handbook Deploy stage Environments - handbook, jtbd Product Direction Teams in the Ops Sub-Department map to several Product Sections. Product direction can be found on the following direction pages: CI Section Direction CD Section Direction Slack channels #ci-section - CI Section discussions spanning the Verify, and Package Stages #cd-section - CD Section discussions spanning Deploy Stage #ops_staff_plus - Foster collaboration and technical leadership within Ops section #doe-ops - Channel for GitLab’s Director of Engineering, Ops 🔒ops-staff-confidential - Channel for reviewing topics for Ops Engineering leaders. Please use #doe-ops or other public channels for topics that don’t require confidentiality. Meetings Zoom Recordings synced to Google Drive GitLab encourages transparency by default, and when meetings are recorded, they can be automatically synced to Google Drive as highlighted in the section about how we conduct video calls at GitLab. To summarize: Record meetings to the cloud in Zoom, and add the text [REC] anywhere in the meeting title (e.g. Google calendar event) It will automatically be added to the GitLab Videos Recorded folder on Google Drive, with a naming convention of youremail-Meeting Title. After a meeting ends, Zoom may take some time to process the recording before it is actually available. The sync to Google Drive happens on the hour mark, so if the recording is not available, it may take another hour to be transferred. Future recordings of recurring meetings can be found in the same folder youremail-Meeting Title, even if alternate hosts start the recording. Ops Engineering Showcase Starting in 2023 in FY24-Q1, a fresh new format for this showcase will include the recording and sharing of videos that team members have created. Once a video has been created, an async discussion issue should be created using this template and listed under the relevant quarterly epic. Based on the amount of questions being discussed in the issue, an AMA may be set up to discuss further in a group setting. Like before, these videos are intended to be opportunities for engineers to show off the things they’ve been working on. Beginning in March 2023 all Ops teams are required to provide at least one showcase video and async discussion issue per month. We require participation in this process because it helps reinforce our values of Results, Transparency, and Iteration. In addition, these showcases are valuable in helping team members across the company better understand the progress and obstacles across the many product areas Ops team members are focused on. They are also fun to watch. These videos will be reviewed monthly by the Director of Engineering and other leaders in the group. The team’s Engineering Manager is the DRI for submitting the showcase, though in many cases the demo may be delegated to another member of the team. Team members are encouraged to use these videos to transparently showcase the current state of their projects. It is not encouraged to spend significant time prepping for these demos or only showcase finished, polished functionality; showing functionality in an incomplete state is encouraged. Videos may be specifically recorded for this purpose or be excerpts from team meetings, etc. Some suggested ideas to consider could be related to error budget improvements, performance improvements to current features, refactoring to codebase for future maintainability, etc. Ops Engineering Showcases Recordings Past Recordings Quarterly Recordings NOTE: - changed to monthly recordings in FY24-Q3.

The intent is to inspire creativity and encourage collaboration amongst those you may not have the opportunity to work with on a regular basis, set aside regular milestone deliverables, and have some fun with tackling different challenges. With the IT landscape rapidly changing with explorations in emerging technologies, having Hackathons take place twice a year offers everyone a chance to contribute to different areas of interest. Planning Processes Planning processes followed by teams in the Sub-department: General Ops Sub-department Planning Process Forced Priority planning/scheduling Our prioritization framework describes a number of Forced Priority labels that present a high risk to our customers and our business. As such, it’s critical that we complete this work within the appropriate SLO/SLAs where possible. An example of this are security issues, here’s a dashboard for past due and soon to be due security issues: https://10az.online.tableau.com/t/gitlab/views/DRAFTIssueTypesDetail/PastDueIssueList/d1401498-2050-4321-b0f4-ab51047fbeb1/1909fa14-fdf0-4682-8a07-f02d8c8d4803 With this in mind, here’s a process that groups are encouraged to use and iterate on in the event that they don’t have an existing approach or are falling behind on SLA/SLOs. To be clear, this is not a required process,",

    "content": "to experiment with working on ideas as possible features that can be integrated into GitLab in the future. The intent is to inspire creativity and encourage collaboration amongst those you may not have the opportunity to work with on a regular basis, set aside regular milestone deliverables, and have some fun with tackling different challenges. With the IT landscape rapidly changing with explorations in emerging technologies, having Hackathons take place twice a year offers everyone a chance to contribute to different areas of interest. Planning Processes Planning processes followed by teams in the Sub-department: General Ops Sub-department Planning Process Forced Priority planning/scheduling Our prioritization framework describes a number of Forced Priority labels that present a high risk to our customers and our business. As such, it’s critical that we complete this work within the appropriate SLO/SLAs where possible. An example of this are security issues, here’s a dashboard for past due and soon to be due security issues: https://10az.online.tableau.com/t/gitlab/views/DRAFTIssueTypesDetail/PastDueIssueList/d1401498-2050-4321-b0f4-ab51047fbeb1/1909fa14-fdf0-4682-8a07-f02d8c8d4803 With this in mind, here’s a process that groups are encouraged to use and iterate on in the event that they don’t have an existing approach or are falling behind on SLA/SLOs. To be clear, this is not a required process, if your group’s approach is working, please continue with that! Ownership of scheduling forced priority work falls on our whole team, not a particular person. When forced priority issues are assigned to your group, schedule those issues right away regardless of severity label Have the team review the issue to make sure there’s a viable solution and plan (weight the issue) Have someone in the group assign themselves to work on the issue Update the issue regularly with progress Treat blockers with the same or higher priority than the original issue Sustaining / Non-Sustaining planning exercise In FY23, each EM in Ops was asked to participate in a capacity planning exercise that involved evaluating the sustaining vs non-sustaining work in their team’s backlog. This exercise was also repeated by the Verify Pipeline teams in FY24 to better understand Engineering capacity needs for each of the Pipeline teams. Each team created a staffing justification based on the breakdown of sustaining vs non-sustaining issues in their backlog. EMs estimated the number of backend engineers and frontend engineers that would be needed, per quarter, of the given fiscal year to burndown these issues, as ordered by the prioritization framework and relevant priority/severity labels. Sustaining work Sustaining work refers to the most important security, availability, scalability and performance, essential for “keeping the lights on” for the feature categories the team supports. Capacity planning for sustaining work was based on meeting the SLO/SLAs of these types of issues. The labels for sustaining work include, but are not limited to: bug::vulnerability (note: specifically this label, as an issue with only a security label does not make it a security vulnerability) bug::availability bug::performance infradev Non-Sustaining work Non-sustaining effort refers to all other work the teams would work on, including: type::feature type::maintenance (e.g. technical debt that does not impact availability, scalability, performance, etc) all other type::bug issues not covered as sustaining work reviewing community contributions responding to customer inquiries / support requests Ops Promotion Process Tips for writing Promotion Documents The format and guidelines are as listed in this Google Doc template Results is our most important value to cover in promotion docs, especially at Staff+ levels. This should be short (making it succinct can be easier to understand), but descriptive enough to show the impact these results have had. Impact should also be highlighted (quantifiable where possible), with examples such as: customer-facing impact (CMAU, ARR growth, retention, adoption, etc) improvements in efficiency, team process or other team metrics Examples demonstrating leadership, ownership and accountability (going above and beyond for your current role): Your role on a project or initiative (“how did you successfully help deliver X?”, “what role did you play in this Working Group?”) MR Review efforts (your role as a maintainer for your team or for the rest of the department in your domain) Collaborating with your team’s stable counterparts Mentoring/coaching others on your team or outside your team (e.g. participation in mentorship programs, coaching in MRs as a reviewer/maintainer) Influencing your team’s technical direction or contributions to more strategic discussions For Staff+ engineers: this could mean authoring or contributing to architectural design documents or leading technical discussions with your team or driving cross-stage collaboration Involvement in recruiting efforts (e.g. as an interviewer and/or reviewer of the technical assessment) Examples of promotion documents from previously approved Ops promotions can be found in this Google Drive folder Promotion Document Reviews Team Member and Manager work together to create promotion document. Promotion document is shared with Ops Sub-Department managers in #ops-staff-confidential channel (private to Ops Managers, Senior Managers, Director) to receive feedback on the document content and how it calibrates with others in the Sub-Department. This can be done early and often. Manager requests another Manager in the Sub-Department review and approve the document. Manager requests Senior Manager in the Sub-Department review and approve the document. Manager requests Director add Team Member to list of Sub-Department planned promotions. If the team member cannot be added Director will provide feedback to Manager as to why. Director presents promotion doc at Development Department quarterly promotion review meeting. If the promotion is not approved Director will provide feedback to Manager as to why. Quarterly Promotion Review Meeting Ops Managers, Sr. Managers, and Directors meet in the last month of each quarter to: Review promotion projections for each group. Managers add a list of their direct reports who they anticipate will be ready for promotion in the next 3 quarters to the meeting agenda. Note these lists may change and are not a guarantee a team member will be promoted in a specific quarter. The lists are used for planning purposes, to help us anticipate the number of team members approaching promotion, budget impact, and to support calibration across the group. These lists should include: Team Member name Targeted promotion quarter",

These lists should include: Team Member name Targeted promotion quarter Link to promotion doc Whether the doc has received any Ops Manager or Ops Senior Manager approvals. Review Ops team member promotion docs planned to be presented at Development Department quarterly promotion review meeting. Promotion Mentor for Staff+ Roles Team members who aspire to advance within our organization are advised to identify a mentor in the targeted role, and reach out to them about a mentorship. Involving a mentor in the peer promotion review process is beneficial, as it ensures: The feedback is informed by comprehensive understanding and relevance to the individual’s development. The feedback, being familiar and constructive, will not catch the mentee off guard and will provide clear directions for improvement from peers they’d work with directly. Individuals pursuing promotion, possibly in consultation with their managers, should maintain regular communication with their mentor to evaluate progress and explore further opportunities for growth. This initiative also aims to cultivate leadership qualities among our senior Staff+ engineers. We plan to trial this optional process in Ops during Q1FY25. Progress and established mentor/mentee pairs can be found in this epic Ops Hiring process We have limited capacity in the recruiting team so hiring managers are experimenting with the Ops Hiring process. We also hold a weekly hiring manager sync meeting (see Meetings section). Objectives & Key Results (OKRs) Creating OKRs Target a 70% completion rate for OKRs so that we are setting goals ambitiously. They should be challenging enough that accomplishing 100% is a stretch goal,since GitLab considers OKRs to be stretch goals by default. If your OKRs are associated with any specific types of issues, consider reviewing the prioritization framework, and align with your team on your OKRs priority relative to one another (for example, OKRs with issues with “forced prioritization”) and be clear on planning of the associated work over the quarter. Ensure Key Results (KRs) are measurable, by specifying a number (% or unit) as the target. Be clear on the starting number, and the expected end result (e.g. from x to y). Ideally create no more than 9 KRs per quarter, ideally with approximately 3 KR per objective. Tracking and completing OKRs Tracking quarterly OKRs for Ops Engineering groups. DRIs are expected to score OKRs on a regular basis, at least monthly, if possible. At the end of the quarter, DRIs can add a retrospective as a comment to reflect on the progress of their KR, in the following format: **Good** - Things that went well... **Bad** - Things that didn't go so well... **Try** - What might you do differently next time?

Project plans should (roughly) follow this format (from https://www.rubick.com/weekly-project-plans/): Weekly project plan template Week of Jan 4th Single chart shows up in Slack. Data is canned. Schedule risk: we're validating our list of chart types are all technically feasible. We'll demo outcome of that investigation. Week of Jan 11th Chart data reflects live information, and is functional in Slack chart. Additional chart type shows in Slack room, with most basic visual design. We've shown to at least one alpha customer for feedback. We start sharing with them every week from here on out. Jessica is on-call and doing interrupt-driven work for week. Week of Jan 18th Most important feedback from alpha customers incorporated. Other work is prioritized to future milestones. Last chart type added. Week of Jan 25th Holiday Jan 26th. Charts look great and are thoroughly tested, instrumented. We'll show usage dashboards. Release end of week. Updates to the plan should be made weekly, marking",

    "content": "are listed as key projects should create these project planning artifacts: Project Plan in the handbook under /engineering/devops/ops/project-plans/<project_name>/index.html.md.erb Since the project plan is stored in the handbook it is easy to track changes in the project plan and see how it evolves over time. Project plans should (roughly) follow this format (from https://www.rubick.com/weekly-project-plans/): Weekly project plan template Week of Jan 4th Single chart shows up in Slack. Data is canned. Schedule risk: we're validating our list of chart types are all technically feasible. We'll demo outcome of that investigation. Week of Jan 11th Chart data reflects live information, and is functional in Slack chart. Additional chart type shows in Slack room, with most basic visual design. We've shown to at least one alpha customer for feedback. We start sharing with them every week from here on out. Jessica is on-call and doing interrupt-driven work for week. Week of Jan 18th Most important feedback from alpha customers incorporated. Other work is prioritized to future milestones. Last chart type added. Week of Jan 25th Holiday Jan 26th. Charts look great and are thoroughly tested, instrumented. We'll show usage dashboards. Release end of week. Updates to the plan should be made weekly, marking weekly items done and making updates based on current information. Authors should merge updates to their project plans without review/approval. We expect the use of project plans to reduce the amount of EM reporting by serving as a SSOT for project execution planning. For example this info no longer needs to be included in async updates (replace with a link to project plan). Key Project Review Meetings We hold periodic sync meetings to review key projects and collaborate on the plans for these important deliverables. Key Project DRIs should prepare for the meeting by creating a Key Project Review Prep Issue. This should be completed and shared at least 48 hours in advance of the meeting to allow time for other team members to review the content. The objective is to keep these meetings focused on execution, technical planning, and accountability within the Engineering group. These are open to anyone who wishes to attend. When it’s necessary to involve a broader group in some cases, we can plan additional follow ups case by case. We aim to meet synchronously where possible given the benefits of being able to talk through the project in a higher bandwidth context. Rescheduling is preferred if the proposed dates are not feasible for attendees. We could re-evaluate whether we can achieve the same goals with async after we have more experience running the process. The focus of the meeting time will be on topics such as: Do we all understand the goals, plan, and timeline? Obstacles/risks and mitigation plans Unmet dependencies Staffing levels Competing priorities How to unblock and/or accelerate Recognizing progress and key team member contributions Async Updates (No Status In Meetings) We have a policy in Ops to keep status updates out of meetings. Instead of reporting on status in meetings Directors, Senior Engineering Managers, Engineering Managers and Principal Engineers provide regular async updates. The content of these updates varies by individual and role: Async Update Guidance Engineering Manager Cadence: Weekly to Monthly (Optional) Topics: Highlights & Accomplishments Team Projects & Priorities (progress, blockers, key decisions, etc.) What’s next - what to expect in next update Senior Engineering Manager Cadence: Monthly (Optional) Topics: Milestone Review Allocation of focus in milestone plans (major features, maintenance, etc.) What tradeoffs or decisions should be made prior to Milestone kickoff? For example: Is the team overcommitted? Does the allocation of effort need to shift to meet specific goals? (e.g. Security SLAs) Principal Engineer Cadence: Weekly (Optional) Topics: Highlights & Accomplishments Projects & Priorities (progress, blockers, key decisions, etc.) To create a weekly async update Create a GitLab issue in any project. Apply the label ~OpsSection::AsyncUpdate. (The label ~OpsSection::Weekly-Update can also be used for backwards compatibility reasons.) Choose a descriptive title. Include your update in the issue description. To HIGHLIGHT an item for broader sharing Begin any paragraph in your update with the text HIGHLIGHT: These paragraphs will automatically be copied into the Highlights & Accomplishments section of the monthly Director’s update. To review Ops weekly async updates All issues with the ~OpsSection::AsyncUpdate or ~OpsSection::Weekly-Update label are summarized in weekly issues in the Ops Status Updates project. All team members are encouraged to comment and ask questions in weekly async update issues. This provides useful feedback to the author and opportunities to collaborate. Director reviews all updates weekly (from the prior week) and provides feedback. Senior EMs reviews all updates from their teams weekly (from the prior week) and provides feedback. Benefits of reporting and reviewing status async vs. synchronously in meetings Collaboration - By sharing announcements, achievements, goals, and plans we are empowering team members with the information they need to make sound decisions and succeed in their roles. Results - Async updates provide an important channel for sharing accomplishments and progress. Efficiency - Expecting each team member to poll for the status they need is extremely inefficient and becomes more inefficient as the organization grows. By using a Publish Subscribe model we are able to share information much more efficiently. Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging - Async status is more inclusive of team members across timezones. Not every team member will be able to make a sync meeting (due to timezone or other factors) but everyone can participate in an async update. Iteration - Taking the time to checkpoint where we are at each week prompts the author and readers to consider ways to iterate and to reflect on incremental progress. Transparency - Sharing information in a consistent, accessible way increases transparency and reduces the threshold for team members to contribute. Escalations from Support Team We are piloting a process to make coordinating with the Support team on customer escalations more efficient.

Supporting Customers on Dedicated instances When teams are asked to triage support requests for customers on GitLab Dedicated and engineers need access to their logs, a sync can be arranged between the engineer and the assigned Support Engineer for a screen sharing session. However, when further troubleshooting is needed by the engineering team or async collaboration is preferred, follow these steps to request access: Create an access request (AR) and list the engineers who require access. (Note that EMs can create this issue and provide Manager Approval on behalf of the engineers) Assign the AR to the EM and PM of the Dedicated group for read-only log access. Reference the AR issue in the support tracker issue so that the Support Engineer is aware.

Please use #doe-ops or other public channels for topics that don’t require confidentiality. Meetings Zoom Recordings synced to Google Drive GitLab encourages transparency by default, and when meetings are recorded, they can be automatically synced to Google Drive as highlighted in the section about how we conduct video calls at GitLab. To summarize: Record meetings to the cloud in Zoom, and add the text [REC] anywhere in the meeting title (e.g. Google calendar event) It will automatically be added to the GitLab Videos Recorded folder on Google Drive, with a naming convention of youremail-Meeting Title. After a meeting ends, Zoom may take some time to process the recording before it is actually available. The sync to Google Drive happens on the hour mark, so if the recording is not available, it may take another hour to be transferred. Future recordings of recurring meetings can be found in the same folder youremail-Meeting Title, even if alternate hosts start the recording. Ops Engineering Showcase Starting in 2023 in FY24-Q1, a fresh new format for this showcase will include the recording and sharing of videos that team members have created. Once a video has been created, an async discussion issue should be created using this template and listed under the relevant quarterly epic. Based on the amount of questions being discussed in the issue, an AMA may be set up to discuss further in a group setting. Like before, these videos are intended to be opportunities for engineers to show off the things they’ve been working on. Beginning in March 2023 all Ops teams are required to provide at least one showcase video and async discussion issue per month. We require participation in this process because it helps reinforce our values of Results, Transparency, and Iteration. In addition, these showcases are valuable in helping team members across the company better understand the progress and obstacles across the many product areas Ops team members are focused on. They are also fun to watch. These videos will be reviewed monthly by the Director of Engineering and other leaders in the group. The team’s Engineering Manager is the DRI for submitting the showcase, though in many cases the demo may be delegated to another member of the team. Team members are encouraged to use these videos to transparently showcase the current state of their projects. It is not encouraged to spend significant time prepping for these demos or only showcase finished, polished functionality; showing functionality in an incomplete state is encouraged. Videos may be specifically recorded for this purpose or be excerpts from team meetings, etc. Some suggested ideas to consider could be related to error budget improvements, performance improvements to current features, refactoring to codebase for future maintainability, etc. Ops Engineering Showcases Recordings Past Recordings Quarterly Recordings NOTE: - changed to monthly recordings in FY24-Q3.

Planning Processes Planning processes followed by teams in the Sub-department: General Ops Sub-department Planning Process Forced Priority planning/scheduling Our prioritization framework describes a number of Forced Priority labels that present a high risk to our customers and our business. As such, it’s critical that we complete this work within the appropriate SLO/SLAs where possible. An example of this are security issues, here’s a dashboard for past due and soon to be due security issues: https://10az.online.tableau.com/t/gitlab/views/DRAFTIssueTypesDetail/PastDueIssueList/d1401498-2050-4321-b0f4-ab51047fbeb1/1909fa14-fdf0-4682-8a07-f02d8c8d4803 With this in mind, here’s a process that groups are encouraged to use and iterate on in the event that they don’t have an existing approach or are falling behind on SLA/SLOs. To be clear, this is not a required process, if your group’s approach is working, please continue with that! Ownership of scheduling forced priority work falls on our whole team, not a particular person. When forced priority issues are assigned to your group, schedule those issues right away regardless of severity label Have the team review the issue to make sure there’s a viable solution and plan (weight the issue) Have someone in the group assign themselves to work on the issue Update the issue regularly with progress Treat blockers with the same or higher priority than the original issue Sustaining / Non-Sustaining planning exercise In FY23, each EM in Ops was asked to participate in a capacity planning exercise that involved evaluating the sustaining vs non-sustaining work in their team’s backlog. This exercise was also repeated by the Verify Pipeline teams in FY24 to better understand Engineering capacity needs for each of the Pipeline teams. Each team created a staffing justification based on the breakdown of sustaining vs non-sustaining issues in their backlog. EMs estimated the number of backend engineers and frontend engineers that would be needed, per quarter, of the given fiscal year to burndown these issues, as ordered by the prioritization framework and relevant priority/severity labels. Sustaining work Sustaining work refers to the most important security, availability, scalability and performance, essential for “keeping the lights on” for the feature categories the team supports. Capacity planning for sustaining work was based on meeting the SLO/SLAs of these types of issues. The labels for sustaining work include, but are not limited to: bug::vulnerability (note: specifically this label, as an issue with only a security label does not make it a security vulnerability) bug::availability bug::performance infradev Non-Sustaining work Non-sustaining effort refers to all other work the teams would work on, including: type::feature type::maintenance (e.g. technical debt that does not impact availability, scalability, performance, etc) all other type::bug issues not covered as sustaining work reviewing community contributions responding to customer inquiries / support requests Ops Promotion Process Tips for writing Promotion Documents The format and guidelines are as listed in this Google Doc template Results is our most important value to cover in promotion docs, especially at Staff+ levels. This should be short (making it succinct can be easier to understand), but descriptive enough to show the impact these results have had. Impact should also be highlighted (quantifiable where possible), with examples such as: customer-facing impact (CMAU, ARR growth, retention, adoption, etc) improvements in efficiency, team process or other team metrics Examples demonstrating leadership, ownership and accountability (going above and beyond for your current role): Your role on a project or initiative (“how did you successfully help deliver X?”, “what role did you play in this Working Group?”) MR Review efforts (your role as a maintainer for your team or for the rest of the department in your domain) Collaborating with your team’s stable counterparts Mentoring/coaching others on your team or outside your team (e.g. participation in mentorship programs, coaching in MRs as a reviewer/maintainer) Influencing your team’s technical direction or contributions to more strategic discussions For Staff+ engineers: this could mean authoring or contributing to architectural design documents or leading technical discussions with your team or driving cross-stage collaboration Involvement in recruiting efforts (e.g. as an interviewer and/or reviewer of the technical assessment) Examples of promotion documents from previously approved Ops promotions can be found in this Google Drive folder Promotion Document Reviews Team Member and Manager work together to create promotion document. Promotion document is shared with Ops Sub-Department managers in #ops-staff-confidential channel (private to Ops Managers, Senior Managers, Director) to receive feedback on the document content and how it calibrates with others in the Sub-Department. This can be done early and often. Manager requests another Manager in the Sub-Department review and approve the document. Manager requests Senior Manager in the Sub-Department review and approve the document. Manager requests Director add Team Member to list of Sub-Department planned promotions. If the team member cannot be added Director will provide feedback to Manager as to why. Director presents promotion doc at Development Department quarterly promotion review meeting. If the promotion is not approved Director will provide feedback to Manager as to why. Quarterly Promotion Review Meeting Ops Managers, Sr. Managers, and Directors meet in the last month of each quarter to: Review promotion projections for each group. Managers add a list of their direct reports who they anticipate will be ready for promotion in the next 3 quarters to the meeting agenda. Note these lists may change and are not a guarantee a team member will be promoted in a specific quarter. The lists are used for planning purposes, to help us anticipate the number of team members approaching promotion, budget impact, and to support calibration across the group. These lists should include: Team Member name Targeted promotion quarter",

Review Ops team member promotion docs planned to be presented at Development Department quarterly promotion review meeting. Promotion Mentor for Staff+ Roles Team members who aspire to advance within our organization are advised to identify a mentor in the targeted role, and reach out to them about a mentorship. Involving a mentor in the peer promotion review process is beneficial, as it ensures: The feedback is informed by comprehensive understanding and relevance to the individual’s development. The feedback, being familiar and constructive, will not catch the mentee off guard and will provide clear directions for improvement from peers they’d work with directly. Individuals pursuing promotion, possibly in consultation with their managers, should maintain regular communication with their mentor to evaluate progress and explore further opportunities for growth. This initiative also aims to cultivate leadership qualities among our senior Staff+ engineers. We plan to trial this optional process in Ops during Q1FY25. Progress and established mentor/mentee pairs can be found in this epic Ops Hiring process We have limited capacity in the recruiting team so hiring managers are experimenting with the Ops Hiring process. We also hold a weekly hiring manager sync meeting (see Meetings section). Objectives & Key Results (OKRs) Creating OKRs Target a 70% completion rate for OKRs so that we are setting goals ambitiously. They should be challenging enough that accomplishing 100% is a stretch goal,since GitLab considers OKRs to be stretch goals by default. If your OKRs are associated with any specific types of issues, consider reviewing the prioritization framework, and align with your team on your OKRs priority relative to one another (for example, OKRs with issues with “forced prioritization”) and be clear on planning of the associated work over the quarter. Ensure Key Results (KRs) are measurable, by specifying a number (% or unit) as the target. Be clear on the starting number, and the expected end result (e.g. from x to y). Ideally create no more than 9 KRs per quarter, ideally with approximately 3 KR per objective. Tracking and completing OKRs Tracking quarterly OKRs for Ops Engineering groups. DRIs are expected to score OKRs on a regular basis, at least monthly, if possible. At the end of the quarter, DRIs can add a retrospective as a comment to reflect on the progress of their KR, in the following format: **Good** - Things that went well... **Bad** - Things that didn't go so well... **Try** - What might you do differently next time?

Charts look great and are thoroughly tested, instrumented. We'll show usage dashboards. Release end of week. Updates to the plan should be made weekly, marking weekly items done and making updates based on current information. Authors should merge updates to their project plans without review/approval. We expect the use of project plans to reduce the amount of EM reporting by serving as a SSOT for project execution planning. For example this info no longer needs to be included in async updates (replace with a link to project plan). Key Project Review Meetings We hold periodic sync meetings to review key projects and collaborate on the plans for these important deliverables. Key Project DRIs should prepare for the meeting by creating a Key Project Review Prep Issue. This should be completed and shared at least 48 hours in advance of the meeting to allow time for other team members to review the content. The objective is to keep these meetings focused on execution, technical planning, and accountability within the Engineering group. These are open to anyone who wishes to attend. When it’s necessary to involve a broader group in some cases, we can plan additional follow ups case by case. We aim to meet synchronously where possible given the benefits of being able to talk through the project in a higher bandwidth context. Rescheduling is preferred if the proposed dates are not feasible for attendees. We could re-evaluate whether we can achieve the same goals with async after we have more experience running the process. The focus of the meeting time will be on topics such as: Do we all understand the goals, plan, and timeline? Obstacles/risks and mitigation plans Unmet dependencies Staffing levels Competing priorities How to unblock and/or accelerate Recognizing progress and key team member contributions Async Updates (No Status In Meetings) We have a policy in Ops to keep status updates out of meetings. Instead of reporting on status in meetings Directors, Senior Engineering Managers, Engineering Managers and Principal Engineers provide regular async updates. The content of these updates varies by individual and role: Async Update Guidance Engineering Manager Cadence: Weekly to Monthly (Optional) Topics: Highlights & Accomplishments Team Projects & Priorities (progress, blockers, key decisions, etc.) What’s next - what to expect in next update Senior Engineering Manager Cadence: Monthly (Optional) Topics: Milestone Review Allocation of focus in milestone plans (major features, maintenance, etc.) What tradeoffs or decisions should be made prior to Milestone kickoff? For example: Is the team overcommitted? Does the allocation of effort need to shift to meet specific goals? (e.g. Security SLAs) Principal Engineer Cadence: Weekly (Optional) Topics: Highlights & Accomplishments Projects & Priorities (progress, blockers, key decisions, etc.) To create a weekly async update Create a GitLab issue in any project. Apply the label ~OpsSection::AsyncUpdate. (The label ~OpsSection::Weekly-Update can also be used for backwards compatibility reasons.) Choose a descriptive title. Include your update in the issue description. To HIGHLIGHT an item for broader sharing Begin any paragraph in your update with the text HIGHLIGHT: These paragraphs will automatically be copied into the Highlights & Accomplishments section of the monthly Director’s update. To review Ops weekly async updates All issues with the ~OpsSection::AsyncUpdate or ~OpsSection::Weekly-Update label are summarized in weekly issues in the Ops Status Updates project. All team members are encouraged to comment and ask questions in weekly async update issues. This provides useful feedback to the author and opportunities to collaborate. Director reviews all updates weekly (from the prior week) and provides feedback. Senior EMs reviews all updates from their teams weekly (from the prior week) and provides feedback. Benefits of reporting and reviewing status async vs. synchronously in meetings Collaboration - By sharing announcements, achievements, goals, and plans we are empowering team members with the information they need to make sound decisions and succeed in their roles. Results - Async updates provide an important channel for sharing accomplishments and progress. Efficiency - Expecting each team member to poll for the status they need is extremely inefficient and becomes more inefficient as the organization grows. By using a Publish Subscribe model we are able to share information much more efficiently. Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging - Async status is more inclusive of team members across timezones. Not every team member will be able to make a sync meeting (due to timezone or other factors) but everyone can participate in an async update. Iteration - Taking the time to checkpoint where we are at each week prompts the author and readers to consider ways to iterate and to reflect on incremental progress. Transparency - Sharing information in a consistent, accessible way increases transparency and reduces the threshold for team members to contribute. Escalations from Support Team We are piloting a process to make coordinating with the Support team on customer escalations more efficient.

Supporting Customers on Dedicated instances When teams are asked to triage support requests for customers on GitLab Dedicated and engineers need access to their logs, a sync can be arranged between the engineer and the assigned Support Engineer for a screen sharing session. However, when further troubleshooting is needed by the engineering team or async collaboration is preferred, follow these steps to request access: Create an access request (AR) and list the engineers who require access. (Note that EMs can create this issue and provide Manager Approval on behalf of the engineers) Assign the AR to the EM and PM of the Dedicated group for read-only log access. Reference the AR issue in the support tracker issue so that the Support Engineer is aware.

Please use #doe-ops or other public channels for topics that don’t require confidentiality. Meetings Zoom Recordings synced to Google Drive GitLab encourages transparency by default, and when meetings are recorded, they can be automatically synced to Google Drive as highlighted in the section about how we conduct video calls at GitLab. To summarize: Record meetings to the cloud in Zoom, and add the text [REC] anywhere in the meeting title (e.g. Google calendar event) It will automatically be added to the GitLab Videos Recorded folder on Google Drive, with a naming convention of youremail-Meeting Title. After a meeting ends, Zoom may take some time to process the recording before it is actually available. The sync to Google Drive happens on the hour mark, so if the recording is not available, it may take another hour to be transferred. Future recordings of recurring meetings can be found in the same folder youremail-Meeting Title, even if alternate hosts start the recording. Ops Engineering Showcase Starting in 2023 in FY24-Q1, a fresh new format for this showcase will include the recording and sharing of videos that team members have created. Once a video has been created, an async discussion issue should be created using this template and listed under the relevant quarterly epic. Based on the amount of questions being discussed in the issue, an AMA may be set up to discuss further in a group setting. Like before, these videos are intended to be opportunities for engineers to show off the things they’ve been working on. Beginning in March 2023 all Ops teams are required to provide at least one showcase video and async discussion issue per month. We require participation in this process because it helps reinforce our values of Results, Transparency, and Iteration. In addition, these showcases are valuable in helping team members across the company better understand the progress and obstacles across the many product areas Ops team members are focused on. They are also fun to watch. These videos will be reviewed monthly by the Director of Engineering and other leaders in the group. The team’s Engineering Manager is the DRI for submitting the showcase, though in many cases the demo may be delegated to another member of the team. Team members are encouraged to use these videos to transparently showcase the current state of their projects. It is not encouraged to spend significant time prepping for these demos or only showcase finished, polished functionality; showing functionality in an incomplete state is encouraged. Videos may be specifically recorded for this purpose or be excerpts from team meetings, etc. Some suggested ideas to consider could be related to error budget improvements, performance improvements to current features, refactoring to codebase for future maintainability, etc. Ops Engineering Showcases Recordings Past Recordings Quarterly Recordings NOTE: - changed to monthly recordings in FY24-Q3.

Planning Processes Planning processes followed by teams in the Sub-department: General Ops Sub-department Planning Process Forced Priority planning/scheduling Our prioritization framework describes a number of Forced Priority labels that present a high risk to our customers and our business. As such, it’s critical that we complete this work within the appropriate SLO/SLAs where possible. An example of this are security issues, here’s a dashboard for past due and soon to be due security issues: https://10az.online.tableau.com/t/gitlab/views/DRAFTIssueTypesDetail/PastDueIssueList/d1401498-2050-4321-b0f4-ab51047fbeb1/1909fa14-fdf0-4682-8a07-f02d8c8d4803 With this in mind, here’s a process that groups are encouraged to use and iterate on in the event that they don’t have an existing approach or are falling behind on SLA/SLOs. To be clear, this is not a required process, if your group’s approach is working, please continue with that! Ownership of scheduling forced priority work falls on our whole team, not a particular person. When forced priority issues are assigned to your group, schedule those issues right away regardless of severity label Have the team review the issue to make sure there’s a viable solution and plan (weight the issue) Have someone in the group assign themselves to work on the issue Update the issue regularly with progress Treat blockers with the same or higher priority than the original issue Sustaining / Non-Sustaining planning exercise In FY23, each EM in Ops was asked to participate in a capacity planning exercise that involved evaluating the sustaining vs non-sustaining work in their team’s backlog. This exercise was also repeated by the Verify Pipeline teams in FY24 to better understand Engineering capacity needs for each of the Pipeline teams. Each team created a staffing justification based on the breakdown of sustaining vs non-sustaining issues in their backlog. EMs estimated the number of backend engineers and frontend engineers that would be needed, per quarter, of the given fiscal year to burndown these issues, as ordered by the prioritization framework and relevant priority/severity labels. Sustaining work Sustaining work refers to the most important security, availability, scalability and performance, essential for “keeping the lights on” for the feature categories the team supports. Capacity planning for sustaining work was based on meeting the SLO/SLAs of these types of issues. The labels for sustaining work include, but are not limited to: bug::vulnerability (note: specifically this label, as an issue with only a security label does not make it a security vulnerability) bug::availability bug::performance infradev Non-Sustaining work Non-sustaining effort refers to all other work the teams would work on, including: type::feature type::maintenance (e.g. technical debt that does not impact availability, scalability, performance, etc) all other type::bug issues not covered as sustaining work reviewing community contributions responding to customer inquiries / support requests Ops Promotion Process Tips for writing Promotion Documents The format and guidelines are as listed in this Google Doc template Results is our most important value to cover in promotion docs, especially at Staff+ levels. This should be short (making it succinct can be easier to understand), but descriptive enough to show the impact these results have had. Impact should also be highlighted (quantifiable where possible), with examples such as: customer-facing impact (CMAU, ARR growth, retention, adoption, etc) improvements in efficiency, team process or other team metrics Examples demonstrating leadership, ownership and accountability (going above and beyond for your current role): Your role on a project or initiative (“how did you successfully help deliver X?”, “what role did you play in this Working Group?”) MR Review efforts (your role as a maintainer for your team or for the rest of the department in your domain) Collaborating with your team’s stable counterparts Mentoring/coaching others on your team or outside your team (e.g. participation in mentorship programs, coaching in MRs as a reviewer/maintainer) Influencing your team’s technical direction or contributions to more strategic discussions For Staff+ engineers: this could mean authoring or contributing to architectural design documents or leading technical discussions with your team or driving cross-stage collaboration Involvement in recruiting efforts (e.g. as an interviewer and/or reviewer of the technical assessment) Examples of promotion documents from previously approved Ops promotions can be found in this Google Drive folder Promotion Document Reviews Team Member and Manager work together to create promotion document. Promotion document is shared with Ops Sub-Department managers in #ops-staff-confidential channel (private to Ops Managers, Senior Managers, Director) to receive feedback on the document content and how it calibrates with others in the Sub-Department. This can be done early and often. Manager requests another Manager in the Sub-Department review and approve the document. Manager requests Senior Manager in the Sub-Department review and approve the document. Manager requests Director add Team Member to list of Sub-Department planned promotions. If the team member cannot be added Director will provide feedback to Manager as to why. Director presents promotion doc at Development Department quarterly promotion review meeting. If the promotion is not approved Director will provide feedback to Manager as to why. Quarterly Promotion Review Meeting Ops Managers, Sr. Managers, and Directors meet in the last month of each quarter to: Review promotion projections for each group. Managers add a list of their direct reports who they anticipate will be ready for promotion in the next 3 quarters to the meeting agenda. Note these lists may change and are not a guarantee a team member will be promoted in a specific quarter. The lists are used for planning purposes, to help us anticipate the number of team members approaching promotion, budget impact, and to support calibration across the group. These lists should include: Team Member name Targeted promotion quarter",

Manager requests Senior Manager in the Sub-Department review and approve the document. Manager requests Director add Team Member to list of Sub-Department planned promotions. If the team member cannot be added Director will provide feedback to Manager as to why. Director presents promotion doc at Development Department quarterly promotion review meeting. If the promotion is not approved Director will provide feedback to Manager as to why. Quarterly Promotion Review Meeting Ops Managers, Sr. Managers, and Directors meet in the last month of each quarter to: Review promotion projections for each group. Managers add a list of their direct reports who they anticipate will be ready for promotion in the next 3 quarters to the meeting agenda. Note these lists may change and are not a guarantee a team member will be promoted in a specific quarter. The lists are used for planning purposes, to help us anticipate the number of team members approaching promotion, budget impact, and to support calibration across the group. These lists should include: Team Member name Targeted promotion quarter Link to promotion doc Whether the doc has received any Ops Manager or Ops Senior Manager approvals. Review Ops team member promotion docs planned to be presented at Development Department quarterly promotion review meeting. Promotion Mentor for Staff+ Roles Team members who aspire to advance within our organization are advised to identify a mentor in the targeted role, and reach out to them about a mentorship. Involving a mentor in the peer promotion review process is beneficial, as it ensures: The feedback is informed by comprehensive understanding and relevance to the individual’s development. The feedback, being familiar and constructive, will not catch the mentee off guard and will provide clear directions for improvement from peers they’d work with directly. Individuals pursuing promotion, possibly in consultation with their managers, should maintain regular communication with their mentor to evaluate progress and explore further opportunities for growth. This initiative also aims to cultivate leadership qualities among our senior Staff+ engineers. We plan to trial this optional process in Ops during Q1FY25. Progress and established mentor/mentee pairs can be found in this epic Ops Hiring process We have limited capacity in the recruiting team so hiring managers are experimenting with the Ops Hiring process. We also hold a weekly hiring manager sync meeting (see Meetings section). Objectives & Key Results (OKRs) Creating OKRs Target a 70% completion rate for OKRs so that we are setting goals ambitiously. They should be challenging enough that accomplishing 100% is a stretch goal,since GitLab considers OKRs to be stretch goals by default. If your OKRs are associated with any specific types of issues, consider reviewing the prioritization framework, and align with your team on your OKRs priority relative to one another (for example, OKRs with issues with “forced prioritization”) and be clear on planning of the associated work over the quarter. Ensure Key Results (KRs) are measurable, by specifying a number (% or unit) as the target. Be clear on the starting number, and the expected end result (e.g. from x to y). Ideally create no more than 9 KRs per quarter, ideally with approximately 3 KR per objective. Tracking and completing OKRs Tracking quarterly OKRs for Ops Engineering groups. DRIs are expected to score OKRs on a regular basis, at least monthly, if possible. At the end of the quarter, DRIs can add a retrospective as a comment to reflect on the progress of their KR, in the following format: **Good** - Things that went well... **Bad** - Things that didn't go so well... **Try** - What might you do differently next time?

Charts look great and are thoroughly tested, instrumented. We'll show usage dashboards. Release end of week. Updates to the plan should be made weekly, marking weekly items done and making updates based on current information. Authors should merge updates to their project plans without review/approval. We expect the use of project plans to reduce the amount of EM reporting by serving as a SSOT for project execution planning. For example this info no longer needs to be included in async updates (replace with a link to project plan). Key Project Review Meetings We hold periodic sync meetings to review key projects and collaborate on the plans for these important deliverables. Key Project DRIs should prepare for the meeting by creating a Key Project Review Prep Issue. This should be completed and shared at least 48 hours in advance of the meeting to allow time for other team members to review the content. The objective is to keep these meetings focused on execution, technical planning, and accountability within the Engineering group. These are open to anyone who wishes to attend. When it’s necessary to involve a broader group in some cases, we can plan additional follow ups case by case. We aim to meet synchronously where possible given the benefits of being able to talk through the project in a higher bandwidth context. Rescheduling is preferred if the proposed dates are not feasible for attendees. We could re-evaluate whether we can achieve the same goals with async after we have more experience running the process. The focus of the meeting time will be on topics such as: Do we all understand the goals, plan, and timeline? Obstacles/risks and mitigation plans Unmet dependencies Staffing levels Competing priorities How to unblock and/or accelerate Recognizing progress and key team member contributions Async Updates (No Status In Meetings) We have a policy in Ops to keep status updates out of meetings. Instead of reporting on status in meetings Directors, Senior Engineering Managers, Engineering Managers and Principal Engineers provide regular async updates. The content of these updates varies by individual and role: Async Update Guidance Engineering Manager Cadence: Weekly to Monthly (Optional) Topics: Highlights & Accomplishments Team Projects & Priorities (progress, blockers, key decisions, etc.) What’s next - what to expect in next update Senior Engineering Manager Cadence: Monthly (Optional) Topics: Milestone Review Allocation of focus in milestone plans (major features, maintenance, etc.) What tradeoffs or decisions should be made prior to Milestone kickoff? For example: Is the team overcommitted? Does the allocation of effort need to shift to meet specific goals? (e.g. Security SLAs) Principal Engineer Cadence: Weekly (Optional) Topics: Highlights & Accomplishments Projects & Priorities (progress, blockers, key decisions, etc.) To create a weekly async update Create a GitLab issue in any project. Apply the label ~OpsSection::AsyncUpdate. (The label ~OpsSection::Weekly-Update can also be used for backwards compatibility reasons.) Choose a descriptive title. Include your update in the issue description. To HIGHLIGHT an item for broader sharing Begin any paragraph in your update with the text HIGHLIGHT: These paragraphs will automatically be copied into the Highlights & Accomplishments section of the monthly Director’s update. To review Ops weekly async updates All issues with the ~OpsSection::AsyncUpdate or ~OpsSection::Weekly-Update label are summarized in weekly issues in the Ops Status Updates project. All team members are encouraged to comment and ask questions in weekly async update issues. This provides useful feedback to the author and opportunities to collaborate. Director reviews all updates weekly (from the prior week) and provides feedback. Senior EMs reviews all updates from their teams weekly (from the prior week) and provides feedback. Benefits of reporting and reviewing status async vs. synchronously in meetings Collaboration - By sharing announcements, achievements, goals, and plans we are empowering team members with the information they need to make sound decisions and succeed in their roles. Results - Async updates provide an important channel for sharing accomplishments and progress. Efficiency - Expecting each team member to poll for the status they need is extremely inefficient and becomes more inefficient as the organization grows. By using a Publish Subscribe model we are able to share information much more efficiently. Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging - Async status is more inclusive of team members across timezones. Not every team member will be able to make a sync meeting (due to timezone or other factors) but everyone can participate in an async update. Iteration - Taking the time to checkpoint where we are at each week prompts the author and readers to consider ways to iterate and to reflect on incremental progress. Transparency - Sharing information in a consistent, accessible way increases transparency and reduces the threshold for team members to contribute. Escalations from Support Team We are piloting a process to make coordinating with the Support team on customer escalations more efficient. See How to Use GitLab.com to Formally Request Help from the GitLab Ops Development Team for process details. If you encounter an Ops-related customer escalation,",

    "content": "information they need to make sound decisions and succeed in their roles. Results - Async updates provide an important channel for sharing accomplishments and progress. Efficiency - Expecting each team member to poll for the status they need is extremely inefficient and becomes more inefficient as the organization grows. By using a Publish Subscribe model we are able to share information much more efficiently. Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging - Async status is more inclusive of team members across timezones. Not every team member will be able to make a sync meeting (due to timezone or other factors) but everyone can participate in an async update. Iteration - Taking the time to checkpoint where we are at each week prompts the author and readers to consider ways to iterate and to reflect on incremental progress. Transparency - Sharing information in a consistent, accessible way increases transparency and reduces the threshold for team members to contribute. Escalations from Support Team We are piloting a process to make coordinating with the Support team on customer escalations more efficient. See How to Use GitLab.com to Formally Request Help from the GitLab Ops Development Team for process details. If you encounter an Ops-related customer escalation, that seems to have a high customer priority, and would benefit from additional visibility, please post a link with a short description in #doe-ops Slack channel. Supporting Customers on Dedicated instances When teams are asked to triage support requests for customers on GitLab Dedicated and engineers need access to their logs, a sync can be arranged between the engineer and the assigned Support Engineer for a screen sharing session. However, when further troubleshooting is needed by the engineering team or async collaboration is preferred, follow these steps to request access: Create an access request (AR) and list the engineers who require access. (Note that EMs can create this issue and provide Manager Approval on behalf of the engineers) Assign the AR to the EM and PM of the Dedicated group for read-only log access. Reference the AR issue in the support tracker issue so that the Support Engineer is aware.

Please use #doe-ops or other public channels for topics that don’t require confidentiality. Meetings Zoom Recordings synced to Google Drive GitLab encourages transparency by default, and when meetings are recorded, they can be automatically synced to Google Drive as highlighted in the section about how we conduct video calls at GitLab. To summarize: Record meetings to the cloud in Zoom, and add the text [REC] anywhere in the meeting title (e.g. Google calendar event) It will automatically be added to the GitLab Videos Recorded folder on Google Drive, with a naming convention of youremail-Meeting Title. After a meeting ends, Zoom may take some time to process the recording before it is actually available. The sync to Google Drive happens on the hour mark, so if the recording is not available, it may take another hour to be transferred. Future recordings of recurring meetings can be found in the same folder youremail-Meeting Title, even if alternate hosts start the recording. Ops Engineering Showcase Starting in 2023 in FY24-Q1, a fresh new format for this showcase will include the recording and sharing of videos that team members have created. Once a video has been created, an async discussion issue should be created using this template and listed under the relevant quarterly epic. Based on the amount of questions being discussed in the issue, an AMA may be set up to discuss further in a group setting. Like before, these videos are intended to be opportunities for engineers to show off the things they’ve been working on. Beginning in March 2023 all Ops teams are required to provide at least one showcase video and async discussion issue per month. We require participation in this process because it helps reinforce our values of Results, Transparency, and Iteration. In addition, these showcases are valuable in helping team members across the company better understand the progress and obstacles across the many product areas Ops team members are focused on. They are also fun to watch. These videos will be reviewed monthly by the Director of Engineering and other leaders in the group. The team’s Engineering Manager is the DRI for submitting the showcase, though in many cases the demo may be delegated to another member of the team. Team members are encouraged to use these videos to transparently showcase the current state of their projects. It is not encouraged to spend significant time prepping for these demos or only showcase finished, polished functionality; showing functionality in an incomplete state is encouraged. Videos may be specifically recorded for this purpose or be excerpts from team meetings, etc. Some suggested ideas to consider could be related to error budget improvements, performance improvements to current features, refactoring to codebase for future maintainability, etc. Ops Engineering Showcases Recordings Past Recordings Quarterly Recordings NOTE: - changed to monthly recordings in FY24-Q3.

The intent is to inspire creativity and encourage collaboration amongst those you may not have the opportunity to work with on a regular basis, set aside regular milestone deliverables, and have some fun with tackling different challenges. With the IT landscape rapidly changing with explorations in emerging technologies, having Hackathons take place twice a year offers everyone a chance to contribute to different areas of interest. Planning Processes Planning processes followed by teams in the Sub-department: General Ops Sub-department Planning Process Forced Priority planning/scheduling Our prioritization framework describes a number of Forced Priority labels that present a high risk to our customers and our business. As such, it’s critical that we complete this work within the appropriate SLO/SLAs where possible. An example of this are security issues, here’s a dashboard for past due and soon to be due security issues: https://10az.online.tableau.com/t/gitlab/views/DRAFTIssueTypesDetail/PastDueIssueList/d1401498-2050-4321-b0f4-ab51047fbeb1/1909fa14-fdf0-4682-8a07-f02d8c8d4803 With this in mind, here’s a process that groups are encouraged to use and iterate on in the event that they don’t have an existing approach or are falling behind on SLA/SLOs. To be clear, this is not a required process,",

    "content": "to experiment with working on ideas as possible features that can be integrated into GitLab in the future. The intent is to inspire creativity and encourage collaboration amongst those you may not have the opportunity to work with on a regular basis, set aside regular milestone deliverables, and have some fun with tackling different challenges. With the IT landscape rapidly changing with explorations in emerging technologies, having Hackathons take place twice a year offers everyone a chance to contribute to different areas of interest. Planning Processes Planning processes followed by teams in the Sub-department: General Ops Sub-department Planning Process Forced Priority planning/scheduling Our prioritization framework describes a number of Forced Priority labels that present a high risk to our customers and our business. As such, it’s critical that we complete this work within the appropriate SLO/SLAs where possible. An example of this are security issues, here’s a dashboard for past due and soon to be due security issues: https://10az.online.tableau.com/t/gitlab/views/DRAFTIssueTypesDetail/PastDueIssueList/d1401498-2050-4321-b0f4-ab51047fbeb1/1909fa14-fdf0-4682-8a07-f02d8c8d4803 With this in mind, here’s a process that groups are encouraged to use and iterate on in the event that they don’t have an existing approach or are falling behind on SLA/SLOs. To be clear, this is not a required process, if your group’s approach is working, please continue with that! Ownership of scheduling forced priority work falls on our whole team, not a particular person. When forced priority issues are assigned to your group, schedule those issues right away regardless of severity label Have the team review the issue to make sure there’s a viable solution and plan (weight the issue) Have someone in the group assign themselves to work on the issue Update the issue regularly with progress Treat blockers with the same or higher priority than the original issue Sustaining / Non-Sustaining planning exercise In FY23, each EM in Ops was asked to participate in a capacity planning exercise that involved evaluating the sustaining vs non-sustaining work in their team’s backlog. This exercise was also repeated by the Verify Pipeline teams in FY24 to better understand Engineering capacity needs for each of the Pipeline teams. Each team created a staffing justification based on the breakdown of sustaining vs non-sustaining issues in their backlog. EMs estimated the number of backend engineers and frontend engineers that would be needed, per quarter, of the given fiscal year to burndown these issues, as ordered by the prioritization framework and relevant priority/severity labels. Sustaining work Sustaining work refers to the most important security, availability, scalability and performance, essential for “keeping the lights on” for the feature categories the team supports. Capacity planning for sustaining work was based on meeting the SLO/SLAs of these types of issues. The labels for sustaining work include, but are not limited to: bug::vulnerability (note: specifically this label, as an issue with only a security label does not make it a security vulnerability) bug::availability bug::performance infradev Non-Sustaining work Non-sustaining effort refers to all other work the teams would work on, including: type::feature type::maintenance (e.g. technical debt that does not impact availability, scalability, performance, etc) all other type::bug issues not covered as sustaining work reviewing community contributions responding to customer inquiries / support requests Ops Promotion Process Tips for writing Promotion Documents The format and guidelines are as listed in this Google Doc template Results is our most important value to cover in promotion docs, especially at Staff+ levels. This should be short (making it succinct can be easier to understand), but descriptive enough to show the impact these results have had. Impact should also be highlighted (quantifiable where possible), with examples such as: customer-facing impact (CMAU, ARR growth, retention, adoption, etc) improvements in efficiency, team process or other team metrics Examples demonstrating leadership, ownership and accountability (going above and beyond for your current role): Your role on a project or initiative (“how did you successfully help deliver X?”, “what role did you play in this Working Group?”) MR Review efforts (your role as a maintainer for your team or for the rest of the department in your domain) Collaborating with your team’s stable counterparts Mentoring/coaching others on your team or outside your team (e.g. participation in mentorship programs, coaching in MRs as a reviewer/maintainer) Influencing your team’s technical direction or contributions to more strategic discussions For Staff+ engineers: this could mean authoring or contributing to architectural design documents or leading technical discussions with your team or driving cross-stage collaboration Involvement in recruiting efforts (e.g. as an interviewer and/or reviewer of the technical assessment) Examples of promotion documents from previously approved Ops promotions can be found in this Google Drive folder Promotion Document Reviews Team Member and Manager work together to create promotion document. Promotion document is shared with Ops Sub-Department managers in #ops-staff-confidential channel (private to Ops Managers, Senior Managers, Director) to receive feedback on the document content and how it calibrates with others in the Sub-Department. This can be done early and often. Manager requests another Manager in the Sub-Department review and approve the document. Manager requests Senior Manager in the Sub-Department review and approve the document. Manager requests Director add Team Member to list of Sub-Department planned promotions. If the team member cannot be added Director will provide feedback to Manager as to why. Director presents promotion doc at Development Department quarterly promotion review meeting. If the promotion is not approved Director will provide feedback to Manager as to why. Quarterly Promotion Review Meeting Ops Managers, Sr. Managers, and Directors meet in the last month of each quarter to: Review promotion projections for each group. Managers add a list of their direct reports who they anticipate will be ready for promotion in the next 3 quarters to the meeting agenda. Note these lists may change and are not a guarantee a team member will be promoted in a specific quarter. The lists are used for planning purposes, to help us anticipate the number of team members approaching promotion, budget impact, and to support calibration across the group. These lists should include: Team Member name Targeted promotion quarter",

These lists should include: Team Member name Targeted promotion quarter Link to promotion doc Whether the doc has received any Ops Manager or Ops Senior Manager approvals. Review Ops team member promotion docs planned to be presented at Development Department quarterly promotion review meeting. Promotion Mentor for Staff+ Roles Team members who aspire to advance within our organization are advised to identify a mentor in the targeted role, and reach out to them about a mentorship. Involving a mentor in the peer promotion review process is beneficial, as it ensures: The feedback is informed by comprehensive understanding and relevance to the individual’s development. The feedback, being familiar and constructive, will not catch the mentee off guard and will provide clear directions for improvement from peers they’d work with directly. Individuals pursuing promotion, possibly in consultation with their managers, should maintain regular communication with their mentor to evaluate progress and explore further opportunities for growth. This initiative also aims to cultivate leadership qualities among our senior Staff+ engineers. We plan to trial this optional process in Ops during Q1FY25. Progress and established mentor/mentee pairs can be found in this epic Ops Hiring process We have limited capacity in the recruiting team so hiring managers are experimenting with the Ops Hiring process. We also hold a weekly hiring manager sync meeting (see Meetings section). Objectives & Key Results (OKRs) Creating OKRs Target a 70% completion rate for OKRs so that we are setting goals ambitiously. They should be challenging enough that accomplishing 100% is a stretch goal,since GitLab considers OKRs to be stretch goals by default. If your OKRs are associated with any specific types of issues, consider reviewing the prioritization framework, and align with your team on your OKRs priority relative to one another (for example, OKRs with issues with “forced prioritization”) and be clear on planning of the associated work over the quarter. Ensure Key Results (KRs) are measurable, by specifying a number (% or unit) as the target. Be clear on the starting number, and the expected end result (e.g. from x to y). Ideally create no more than 9 KRs per quarter, ideally with approximately 3 KR per objective. Tracking and completing OKRs Tracking quarterly OKRs for Ops Engineering groups. DRIs are expected to score OKRs on a regular basis, at least monthly, if possible. At the end of the quarter, DRIs can add a retrospective as a comment to reflect on the progress of their KR, in the following format: **Good** - Things that went well... **Bad** - Things that didn't go so well... **Try** - What might you do differently next time?

Schedule risk: we're validating our list of chart types are all technically feasible. We'll demo outcome of that investigation. Week of Jan 11th Chart data reflects live information, and is functional in Slack chart. Additional chart type shows in Slack room, with most basic visual design. We've shown to at least one alpha customer for feedback. We start sharing with them every week from here on out. Jessica is on-call and doing interrupt-driven work for week. Week of Jan 18th Most important feedback from alpha customers incorporated. Other work is prioritized to future milestones. Last chart type added. Week of Jan 25th Holiday Jan 26th.

    "content": "are listed as key projects should create these project planning artifacts: Project Plan in the handbook under /engineering/devops/ops/project-plans/<project_name>/index.html.md.erb Since the project plan is stored in the handbook it is easy to track changes in the project plan and see how it evolves over time. Project plans should (roughly) follow this format (from https://www.rubick.com/weekly-project-plans/): Weekly project plan template Week of Jan 4th Single chart shows up in Slack. Data is canned. Schedule risk: we're validating our list of chart types are all technically feasible. We'll demo outcome of that investigation. Week of Jan 11th Chart data reflects live information, and is functional in Slack chart. Additional chart type shows in Slack room, with most basic visual design. We've shown to at least one alpha customer for feedback. We start sharing with them every week from here on out. Jessica is on-call and doing interrupt-driven work for week. Week of Jan 18th Most important feedback from alpha customers incorporated. Other work is prioritized to future milestones. Last chart type added. Week of Jan 25th Holiday Jan 26th. Charts look great and are thoroughly tested, instrumented. We'll show usage dashboards. Release end of week. Updates to the plan should be made weekly, marking weekly items done and making updates based on current information. Authors should merge updates to their project plans without review/approval. We expect the use of project plans to reduce the amount of EM reporting by serving as a SSOT for project execution planning. For example this info no longer needs to be included in async updates (replace with a link to project plan). Key Project Review Meetings We hold periodic sync meetings to review key projects and collaborate on the plans for these important deliverables. Key Project DRIs should prepare for the meeting by creating a Key Project Review Prep Issue. This should be completed and shared at least 48 hours in advance of the meeting to allow time for other team members to review the content. The objective is to keep these meetings focused on execution, technical planning, and accountability within the Engineering group. These are open to anyone who wishes to attend. When it’s necessary to involve a broader group in some cases, we can plan additional follow ups case by case. We aim to meet synchronously where possible given the benefits of being able to talk through the project in a higher bandwidth context. Rescheduling is preferred if the proposed dates are not feasible for attendees. We could re-evaluate whether we can achieve the same goals with async after we have more experience running the process. The focus of the meeting time will be on topics such as: Do we all understand the goals, plan, and timeline? Obstacles/risks and mitigation plans Unmet dependencies Staffing levels Competing priorities How to unblock and/or accelerate Recognizing progress and key team member contributions Async Updates (No Status In Meetings) We have a policy in Ops to keep status updates out of meetings. Instead of reporting on status in meetings Directors, Senior Engineering Managers, Engineering Managers and Principal Engineers provide regular async updates. The content of these updates varies by individual and role: Async Update Guidance Engineering Manager Cadence: Weekly to Monthly (Optional) Topics: Highlights & Accomplishments Team Projects & Priorities (progress, blockers, key decisions, etc.) What’s next - what to expect in next update Senior Engineering Manager Cadence: Monthly (Optional) Topics: Milestone Review Allocation of focus in milestone plans (major features, maintenance, etc.) What tradeoffs or decisions should be made prior to Milestone kickoff? For example: Is the team overcommitted? Does the allocation of effort need to shift to meet specific goals? (e.g. Security SLAs) Principal Engineer Cadence: Weekly (Optional) Topics: Highlights & Accomplishments Projects & Priorities (progress, blockers, key decisions, etc.) To create a weekly async update Create a GitLab issue in any project. Apply the label ~OpsSection::AsyncUpdate. (The label ~OpsSection::Weekly-Update can also be used for backwards compatibility reasons.) Choose a descriptive title. Include your update in the issue description. To HIGHLIGHT an item for broader sharing Begin any paragraph in your update with the text HIGHLIGHT: These paragraphs will automatically be copied into the Highlights & Accomplishments section of the monthly Director’s update. To review Ops weekly async updates All issues with the ~OpsSection::AsyncUpdate or ~OpsSection::Weekly-Update label are summarized in weekly issues in the Ops Status Updates project. All team members are encouraged to comment and ask questions in weekly async update issues. This provides useful feedback to the author and opportunities to collaborate. Director reviews all updates weekly (from the prior week) and provides feedback. Senior EMs reviews all updates from their teams weekly (from the prior week) and provides feedback. Benefits of reporting and reviewing status async vs. synchronously in meetings Collaboration - By sharing announcements, achievements, goals, and plans we are empowering team members with the information they need to make sound decisions and succeed in their roles. Results - Async updates provide an important channel for sharing accomplishments and progress. Efficiency - Expecting each team member to poll for the status they need is extremely inefficient and becomes more inefficient as the organization grows. By using a Publish Subscribe model we are able to share information much more efficiently. Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging - Async status is more inclusive of team members across timezones. Not every team member will be able to make a sync meeting (due to timezone or other factors) but everyone can participate in an async update. Iteration - Taking the time to checkpoint where we are at each week prompts the author and readers to consider ways to iterate and to reflect on incremental progress. Transparency - Sharing information in a consistent, accessible way increases transparency and reduces the threshold for team members to contribute. Escalations from Support Team We are piloting a process to make coordinating with the Support team on customer escalations more efficient.

Supporting Customers on Dedicated instances When teams are asked to triage support requests for customers on GitLab Dedicated and engineers need access to their logs, a sync can be arranged between the engineer and the assigned Support Engineer for a screen sharing session. However, when further troubleshooting is needed by the engineering team or async collaboration is preferred, follow these steps to request access: Create an access request (AR) and list the engineers who require access. (Note that EMs can create this issue and provide Manager Approval on behalf of the engineers) Assign the AR to the EM and PM of the Dedicated group for read-only log access. Reference the AR issue in the support tracker issue so that the Support Engineer is aware.

The Ops Sub-department is composed of development teams working on Verify, Package, Deploy, Sevice Management and Observability features of GitLab DevOps Platform. Teams and Handbook Pages The following teams comprise the Ops sub-department: Verify stage - handbook Pipeline Execution - handbook, jtbd Pipeline Authoring - handbook, jtbd Runner - handbook, jtbd CI Platform - handbook Package stage - handbook, jtbd Container Registry - handbook Package Registry - handbook Deploy stage Environments - handbook, jtbd Product Direction Teams in the Ops Sub-Department map to several Product Sections.

Please use #doe-ops or other public channels for topics that don’t require confidentiality. Meetings Zoom Recordings synced to Google Drive GitLab encourages transparency by default, and when meetings are recorded, they can be automatically synced to Google Drive as highlighted in the section about how we conduct video calls at GitLab. To summarize: Record meetings to the cloud in Zoom, and add the text [REC] anywhere in the meeting title (e.g. Google calendar event) It will automatically be added to the GitLab Videos Recorded folder on Google Drive, with a naming convention of youremail-Meeting Title. After a meeting ends, Zoom may take some time to process the recording before it is actually available. The sync to Google Drive happens on the hour mark, so if the recording is not available, it may take another hour to be transferred. Future recordings of recurring meetings can be found in the same folder youremail-Meeting Title, even if alternate hosts start the recording. Ops Engineering Showcase Starting in 2023 in FY24-Q1, a fresh new format for this showcase will include the recording and sharing of videos that team members have created. Once a video has been created, an async discussion issue should be created using this template and listed under the relevant quarterly epic. Based on the amount of questions being discussed in the issue, an AMA may be set up to discuss further in a group setting. Like before, these videos are intended to be opportunities for engineers to show off the things they’ve been working on. Beginning in March 2023 all Ops teams are required to provide at least one showcase video and async discussion issue per month. We require participation in this process because it helps reinforce our values of Results, Transparency, and Iteration. In addition, these showcases are valuable in helping team members across the company better understand the progress and obstacles across the many product areas Ops team members are focused on. They are also fun to watch. These videos will be reviewed monthly by the Director of Engineering and other leaders in the group. The team’s Engineering Manager is the DRI for submitting the showcase, though in many cases the demo may be delegated to another member of the team. Team members are encouraged to use these videos to transparently showcase the current state of their projects. It is not encouraged to spend significant time prepping for these demos or only showcase finished, polished functionality; showing functionality in an incomplete state is encouraged. Videos may be specifically recorded for this purpose or be excerpts from team meetings, etc. Some suggested ideas to consider could be related to error budget improvements, performance improvements to current features, refactoring to codebase for future maintainability, etc. Ops Engineering Showcases Recordings Past Recordings Quarterly Recordings NOTE: - changed to monthly recordings in FY24-Q3.

Planning Processes Planning processes followed by teams in the Sub-department: General Ops Sub-department Planning Process Forced Priority planning/scheduling Our prioritization framework describes a number of Forced Priority labels that present a high risk to our customers and our business. As such, it’s critical that we complete this work within the appropriate SLO/SLAs where possible. An example of this are security issues, here’s a dashboard for past due and soon to be due security issues: https://10az.online.tableau.com/t/gitlab/views/DRAFTIssueTypesDetail/PastDueIssueList/d1401498-2050-4321-b0f4-ab51047fbeb1/1909fa14-fdf0-4682-8a07-f02d8c8d4803 With this in mind, here’s a process that groups are encouraged to use and iterate on in the event that they don’t have an existing approach or are falling behind on SLA/SLOs. To be clear, this is not a required process, if your group’s approach is working, please continue with that! Ownership of scheduling forced priority work falls on our whole team, not a particular person. When forced priority issues are assigned to your group, schedule those issues right away regardless of severity label Have the team review the issue to make sure there’s a viable solution and plan (weight the issue) Have someone in the group assign themselves to work on the issue Update the issue regularly with progress Treat blockers with the same or higher priority than the original issue Sustaining / Non-Sustaining planning exercise In FY23, each EM in Ops was asked to participate in a capacity planning exercise that involved evaluating the sustaining vs non-sustaining work in their team’s backlog. This exercise was also repeated by the Verify Pipeline teams in FY24 to better understand Engineering capacity needs for each of the Pipeline teams. Each team created a staffing justification based on the breakdown of sustaining vs non-sustaining issues in their backlog. EMs estimated the number of backend engineers and frontend engineers that would be needed, per quarter, of the given fiscal year to burndown these issues, as ordered by the prioritization framework and relevant priority/severity labels. Sustaining work Sustaining work refers to the most important security, availability, scalability and performance, essential for “keeping the lights on” for the feature categories the team supports. Capacity planning for sustaining work was based on meeting the SLO/SLAs of these types of issues. The labels for sustaining work include, but are not limited to: bug::vulnerability (note: specifically this label, as an issue with only a security label does not make it a security vulnerability) bug::availability bug::performance infradev Non-Sustaining work Non-sustaining effort refers to all other work the teams would work on, including: type::feature type::maintenance (e.g. technical debt that does not impact availability, scalability, performance, etc) all other type::bug issues not covered as sustaining work reviewing community contributions responding to customer inquiries / support requests Ops Promotion Process Tips for writing Promotion Documents The format and guidelines are as listed in this Google Doc template Results is our most important value to cover in promotion docs, especially at Staff+ levels. This should be short (making it succinct can be easier to understand), but descriptive enough to show the impact these results have had. Impact should also be highlighted (quantifiable where possible), with examples such as: customer-facing impact (CMAU, ARR growth, retention, adoption, etc) improvements in efficiency, team process or other team metrics Examples demonstrating leadership, ownership and accountability (going above and beyond for your current role): Your role on a project or initiative (“how did you successfully help deliver X?”, “what role did you play in this Working Group?”) MR Review efforts (your role as a maintainer for your team or for the rest of the department in your domain) Collaborating with your team’s stable counterparts Mentoring/coaching others on your team or outside your team (e.g. participation in mentorship programs, coaching in MRs as a reviewer/maintainer) Influencing your team’s technical direction or contributions to more strategic discussions For Staff+ engineers: this could mean authoring or contributing to architectural design documents or leading technical discussions with your team or driving cross-stage collaboration Involvement in recruiting efforts (e.g. as an interviewer and/or reviewer of the technical assessment) Examples of promotion documents from previously approved Ops promotions can be found in this Google Drive folder Promotion Document Reviews Team Member and Manager work together to create promotion document. Promotion document is shared with Ops Sub-Department managers in #ops-staff-confidential channel (private to Ops Managers, Senior Managers, Director) to receive feedback on the document content and how it calibrates with others in the Sub-Department. This can be done early and often. Manager requests another Manager in the Sub-Department review and approve the document. Manager requests Senior Manager in the Sub-Department review and approve the document. Manager requests Director add Team Member to list of Sub-Department planned promotions. If the team member cannot be added Director will provide feedback to Manager as to why. Director presents promotion doc at Development Department quarterly promotion review meeting. If the promotion is not approved Director will provide feedback to Manager as to why. Quarterly Promotion Review Meeting Ops Managers, Sr. Managers, and Directors meet in the last month of each quarter to: Review promotion projections for each group. Managers add a list of their direct reports who they anticipate will be ready for promotion in the next 3 quarters to the meeting agenda. Note these lists may change and are not a guarantee a team member will be promoted in a specific quarter. The lists are used for planning purposes, to help us anticipate the number of team members approaching promotion, budget impact, and to support calibration across the group. These lists should include: Team Member name Targeted promotion quarter",

    "content": "how it calibrates with others in the Sub-Department. This can be done early and often. Manager requests another Manager in the Sub-Department review and approve the document. Manager requests Senior Manager in the Sub-Department review and approve the document. Manager requests Director add Team Member to list of Sub-Department planned promotions. If the team member cannot be added Director will provide feedback to Manager as to why. Director presents promotion doc at Development Department quarterly promotion review meeting. If the promotion is not approved Director will provide feedback to Manager as to why. Quarterly Promotion Review Meeting Ops Managers, Sr. Managers, and Directors meet in the last month of each quarter to: Review promotion projections for each group. Managers add a list of their direct reports who they anticipate will be ready for promotion in the next 3 quarters to the meeting agenda. Note these lists may change and are not a guarantee a team member will be promoted in a specific quarter. The lists are used for planning purposes, to help us anticipate the number of team members approaching promotion, budget impact, and to support calibration across the group. These lists should include: Team Member name Targeted promotion quarter Link to promotion doc Whether the doc has received any Ops Manager or Ops Senior Manager approvals. Review Ops team member promotion docs planned to be presented at Development Department quarterly promotion review meeting. Promotion Mentor for Staff+ Roles Team members who aspire to advance within our organization are advised to identify a mentor in the targeted role, and reach out to them about a mentorship. Involving a mentor in the peer promotion review process is beneficial, as it ensures: The feedback is informed by comprehensive understanding and relevance to the individual’s development. The feedback, being familiar and constructive, will not catch the mentee off guard and will provide clear directions for improvement from peers they’d work with directly. Individuals pursuing promotion, possibly in consultation with their managers, should maintain regular communication with their mentor to evaluate progress and explore further opportunities for growth. This initiative also aims to cultivate leadership qualities among our senior Staff+ engineers. We plan to trial this optional process in Ops during Q1FY25. Progress and established mentor/mentee pairs can be found in this epic Ops Hiring process We have limited capacity in the recruiting team so hiring managers are experimenting with the Ops Hiring process. We also hold a weekly hiring manager sync meeting (see Meetings section). Objectives & Key Results (OKRs) Creating OKRs Target a 70% completion rate for OKRs so that we are setting goals ambitiously. They should be challenging enough that accomplishing 100% is a stretch goal,since GitLab considers OKRs to be stretch goals by default. If your OKRs are associated with any specific types of issues, consider reviewing the prioritization framework, and align with your team on your OKRs priority relative to one another (for example, OKRs with issues with “forced prioritization”) and be clear on planning of the associated work over the quarter. Ensure Key Results (KRs) are measurable, by specifying a number (% or unit) as the target. Be clear on the starting number, and the expected end result (e.g. from x to y). Ideally create no more than 9 KRs per quarter, ideally with approximately 3 KR per objective. Tracking and completing OKRs Tracking quarterly OKRs for Ops Engineering groups. DRIs are expected to score OKRs on a regular basis, at least monthly, if possible. At the end of the quarter, DRIs can add a retrospective as a comment to reflect on the progress of their KR, in the following format: **Good** - Things that went well... **Bad** - Things that didn't go so well... **Try** - What might you do differently next time? Key Projects For projects that span many milestones we are experimenting with additional project management processes.

Charts look great and are thoroughly tested, instrumented. We'll show usage dashboards. Release end of week. Updates to the plan should be made weekly, marking weekly items done and making updates based on current information. Authors should merge updates to their project plans without review/approval. We expect the use of project plans to reduce the amount of EM reporting by serving as a SSOT for project execution planning. For example this info no longer needs to be included in async updates (replace with a link to project plan). Key Project Review Meetings We hold periodic sync meetings to review key projects and collaborate on the plans for these important deliverables. Key Project DRIs should prepare for the meeting by creating a Key Project Review Prep Issue. This should be completed and shared at least 48 hours in advance of the meeting to allow time for other team members to review the content. The objective is to keep these meetings focused on execution, technical planning, and accountability within the Engineering group. These are open to anyone who wishes to attend. When it’s necessary to involve a broader group in some cases, we can plan additional follow ups case by case. We aim to meet synchronously where possible given the benefits of being able to talk through the project in a higher bandwidth context. Rescheduling is preferred if the proposed dates are not feasible for attendees. We could re-evaluate whether we can achieve the same goals with async after we have more experience running the process. The focus of the meeting time will be on topics such as: Do we all understand the goals, plan, and timeline? Obstacles/risks and mitigation plans Unmet dependencies Staffing levels Competing priorities How to unblock and/or accelerate Recognizing progress and key team member contributions Async Updates (No Status In Meetings) We have a policy in Ops to keep status updates out of meetings. Instead of reporting on status in meetings Directors, Senior Engineering Managers, Engineering Managers and Principal Engineers provide regular async updates. The content of these updates varies by individual and role: Async Update Guidance Engineering Manager Cadence: Weekly to Monthly (Optional) Topics: Highlights & Accomplishments Team Projects & Priorities (progress, blockers, key decisions, etc.) What’s next - what to expect in next update Senior Engineering Manager Cadence: Monthly (Optional) Topics: Milestone Review Allocation of focus in milestone plans (major features, maintenance, etc.) What tradeoffs or decisions should be made prior to Milestone kickoff? For example: Is the team overcommitted? Does the allocation of effort need to shift to meet specific goals? (e.g. Security SLAs) Principal Engineer Cadence: Weekly (Optional) Topics: Highlights & Accomplishments Projects & Priorities (progress, blockers, key decisions, etc.) To create a weekly async update Create a GitLab issue in any project. Apply the label ~OpsSection::AsyncUpdate. (The label ~OpsSection::Weekly-Update can also be used for backwards compatibility reasons.) Choose a descriptive title. Include your update in the issue description. To HIGHLIGHT an item for broader sharing Begin any paragraph in your update with the text HIGHLIGHT: These paragraphs will automatically be copied into the Highlights & Accomplishments section of the monthly Director’s update. To review Ops weekly async updates All issues with the ~OpsSection::AsyncUpdate or ~OpsSection::Weekly-Update label are summarized in weekly issues in the Ops Status Updates project. All team members are encouraged to comment and ask questions in weekly async update issues. This provides useful feedback to the author and opportunities to collaborate. Director reviews all updates weekly (from the prior week) and provides feedback. Senior EMs reviews all updates from their teams weekly (from the prior week) and provides feedback. Benefits of reporting and reviewing status async vs. synchronously in meetings Collaboration - By sharing announcements, achievements, goals, and plans we are empowering team members with the information they need to make sound decisions and succeed in their roles. Results - Async updates provide an important channel for sharing accomplishments and progress. Efficiency - Expecting each team member to poll for the status they need is extremely inefficient and becomes more inefficient as the organization grows. By using a Publish Subscribe model we are able to share information much more efficiently. Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging - Async status is more inclusive of team members across timezones. Not every team member will be able to make a sync meeting (due to timezone or other factors) but everyone can participate in an async update. Iteration - Taking the time to checkpoint where we are at each week prompts the author and readers to consider ways to iterate and to reflect on incremental progress. Transparency - Sharing information in a consistent, accessible way increases transparency and reduces the threshold for team members to contribute. Escalations from Support Team We are piloting a process to make coordinating with the Support team on customer escalations more efficient. See How to Use GitLab.com to Formally Request Help from the GitLab Ops Development Team for process details. If you encounter an Ops-related customer escalation,",

    "content": "information they need to make sound decisions and succeed in their roles. Results - Async updates provide an important channel for sharing accomplishments and progress. Efficiency - Expecting each team member to poll for the status they need is extremely inefficient and becomes more inefficient as the organization grows. By using a Publish Subscribe model we are able to share information much more efficiently. Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging - Async status is more inclusive of team members across timezones. Not every team member will be able to make a sync meeting (due to timezone or other factors) but everyone can participate in an async update. Iteration - Taking the time to checkpoint where we are at each week prompts the author and readers to consider ways to iterate and to reflect on incremental progress. Transparency - Sharing information in a consistent, accessible way increases transparency and reduces the threshold for team members to contribute. Escalations from Support Team We are piloting a process to make coordinating with the Support team on customer escalations more efficient. See How to Use GitLab.com to Formally Request Help from the GitLab Ops Development Team for process details. If you encounter an Ops-related customer escalation, that seems to have a high customer priority, and would benefit from additional visibility, please post a link with a short description in #doe-ops Slack channel. Supporting Customers on Dedicated instances When teams are asked to triage support requests for customers on GitLab Dedicated and engineers need access to their logs, a sync can be arranged between the engineer and the assigned Support Engineer for a screen sharing session. However, when further troubleshooting is needed by the engineering team or async collaboration is preferred, follow these steps to request access: Create an access request (AR) and list the engineers who require access. (Note that EMs can create this issue and provide Manager Approval on behalf of the engineers) Assign the AR to the EM and PM of the Dedicated group for read-only log access. Reference the AR issue in the support tracker issue so that the Support Engineer is aware.

    "content": "Ops Sub-department The Ops Sub-department is composed of development teams working on Verify, Package, Deploy, and Monitor features of GitLab DevOps Platform. The Ops Sub-department is composed of development teams working on Verify, Package, Deploy, Sevice Management and Observability features of GitLab DevOps Platform. Teams and Handbook Pages The following teams comprise the Ops sub-department: Verify stage - handbook Pipeline Execution - handbook, jtbd Pipeline Authoring - handbook, jtbd Runner - handbook, jtbd CI Platform - handbook Package stage - handbook, jtbd Container Registry - handbook Package Registry - handbook Deploy stage Environments - handbook, jtbd Product Direction Teams in the Ops Sub-Department map to several Product Sections.

Please use #doe-ops or other public channels for topics that don’t require confidentiality. Meetings Zoom Recordings synced to Google Drive GitLab encourages transparency by default, and when meetings are recorded, they can be automatically synced to Google Drive as highlighted in the section about how we conduct video calls at GitLab. To summarize: Record meetings to the cloud in Zoom, and add the text [REC] anywhere in the meeting title (e.g. Google calendar event) It will automatically be added to the GitLab Videos Recorded folder on Google Drive, with a naming convention of youremail-Meeting Title. After a meeting ends, Zoom may take some time to process the recording before it is actually available. The sync to Google Drive happens on the hour mark, so if the recording is not available, it may take another hour to be transferred. Future recordings of recurring meetings can be found in the same folder youremail-Meeting Title, even if alternate hosts start the recording. Ops Engineering Showcase Starting in 2023 in FY24-Q1, a fresh new format for this showcase will include the recording and sharing of videos that team members have created. Once a video has been created, an async discussion issue should be created using this template and listed under the relevant quarterly epic. Based on the amount of questions being discussed in the issue, an AMA may be set up to discuss further in a group setting. Like before, these videos are intended to be opportunities for engineers to show off the things they’ve been working on. Beginning in March 2023 all Ops teams are required to provide at least one showcase video and async discussion issue per month. We require participation in this process because it helps reinforce our values of Results, Transparency, and Iteration. In addition, these showcases are valuable in helping team members across the company better understand the progress and obstacles across the many product areas Ops team members are focused on. They are also fun to watch. These videos will be reviewed monthly by the Director of Engineering and other leaders in the group. The team’s Engineering Manager is the DRI for submitting the showcase, though in many cases the demo may be delegated to another member of the team. Team members are encouraged to use these videos to transparently showcase the current state of their projects. It is not encouraged to spend significant time prepping for these demos or only showcase finished, polished functionality; showing functionality in an incomplete state is encouraged. Videos may be specifically recorded for this purpose or be excerpts from team meetings, etc. Some suggested ideas to consider could be related to error budget improvements, performance improvements to current features, refactoring to codebase for future maintainability, etc. Ops Engineering Showcases Recordings Past Recordings Quarterly Recordings NOTE: - changed to monthly recordings in FY24-Q3.

The intent is to inspire creativity and encourage collaboration amongst those you may not have the opportunity to work with on a regular basis, set aside regular milestone deliverables, and have some fun with tackling different challenges. With the IT landscape rapidly changing with explorations in emerging technologies, having Hackathons take place twice a year offers everyone a chance to contribute to different areas of interest. Planning Processes Planning processes followed by teams in the Sub-department: General Ops Sub-department Planning Process Forced Priority planning/scheduling Our prioritization framework describes a number of Forced Priority labels that present a high risk to our customers and our business. As such, it’s critical that we complete this work within the appropriate SLO/SLAs where possible. An example of this are security issues, here’s a dashboard for past due and soon to be due security issues: https://10az.online.tableau.com/t/gitlab/views/DRAFTIssueTypesDetail/PastDueIssueList/d1401498-2050-4321-b0f4-ab51047fbeb1/1909fa14-fdf0-4682-8a07-f02d8c8d4803 With this in mind, here’s a process that groups are encouraged to use and iterate on in the event that they don’t have an existing approach or are falling behind on SLA/SLOs. To be clear, this is not a required process,",

    "content": "to experiment with working on ideas as possible features that can be integrated into GitLab in the future. The intent is to inspire creativity and encourage collaboration amongst those you may not have the opportunity to work with on a regular basis, set aside regular milestone deliverables, and have some fun with tackling different challenges. With the IT landscape rapidly changing with explorations in emerging technologies, having Hackathons take place twice a year offers everyone a chance to contribute to different areas of interest. Planning Processes Planning processes followed by teams in the Sub-department: General Ops Sub-department Planning Process Forced Priority planning/scheduling Our prioritization framework describes a number of Forced Priority labels that present a high risk to our customers and our business. As such, it’s critical that we complete this work within the appropriate SLO/SLAs where possible. An example of this are security issues, here’s a dashboard for past due and soon to be due security issues: https://10az.online.tableau.com/t/gitlab/views/DRAFTIssueTypesDetail/PastDueIssueList/d1401498-2050-4321-b0f4-ab51047fbeb1/1909fa14-fdf0-4682-8a07-f02d8c8d4803 With this in mind, here’s a process that groups are encouraged to use and iterate on in the event that they don’t have an existing approach or are falling behind on SLA/SLOs. To be clear, this is not a required process, if your group’s approach is working, please continue with that! Ownership of scheduling forced priority work falls on our whole team, not a particular person. When forced priority issues are assigned to your group, schedule those issues right away regardless of severity label Have the team review the issue to make sure there’s a viable solution and plan (weight the issue) Have someone in the group assign themselves to work on the issue Update the issue regularly with progress Treat blockers with the same or higher priority than the original issue Sustaining / Non-Sustaining planning exercise In FY23, each EM in Ops was asked to participate in a capacity planning exercise that involved evaluating the sustaining vs non-sustaining work in their team’s backlog. This exercise was also repeated by the Verify Pipeline teams in FY24 to better understand Engineering capacity needs for each of the Pipeline teams. Each team created a staffing justification based on the breakdown of sustaining vs non-sustaining issues in their backlog. EMs estimated the number of backend engineers and frontend engineers that would be needed, per quarter, of the given fiscal year to burndown these issues, as ordered by the prioritization framework and relevant priority/severity labels. Sustaining work Sustaining work refers to the most important security, availability, scalability and performance, essential for “keeping the lights on” for the feature categories the team supports. Capacity planning for sustaining work was based on meeting the SLO/SLAs of these types of issues. The labels for sustaining work include, but are not limited to: bug::vulnerability (note: specifically this label, as an issue with only a security label does not make it a security vulnerability) bug::availability bug::performance infradev Non-Sustaining work Non-sustaining effort refers to all other work the teams would work on, including: type::feature type::maintenance (e.g. technical debt that does not impact availability, scalability, performance, etc) all other type::bug issues not covered as sustaining work reviewing community contributions responding to customer inquiries / support requests Ops Promotion Process Tips for writing Promotion Documents The format and guidelines are as listed in this Google Doc template Results is our most important value to cover in promotion docs, especially at Staff+ levels. This should be short (making it succinct can be easier to understand), but descriptive enough to show the impact these results have had. Impact should also be highlighted (quantifiable where possible), with examples such as: customer-facing impact (CMAU, ARR growth, retention, adoption, etc) improvements in efficiency, team process or other team metrics Examples demonstrating leadership, ownership and accountability (going above and beyond for your current role): Your role on a project or initiative (“how did you successfully help deliver X?”, “what role did you play in this Working Group?”) MR Review efforts (your role as a maintainer for your team or for the rest of the department in your domain) Collaborating with your team’s stable counterparts Mentoring/coaching others on your team or outside your team (e.g. participation in mentorship programs, coaching in MRs as a reviewer/maintainer) Influencing your team’s technical direction or contributions to more strategic discussions For Staff+ engineers: this could mean authoring or contributing to architectural design documents or leading technical discussions with your team or driving cross-stage collaboration Involvement in recruiting efforts (e.g. as an interviewer and/or reviewer of the technical assessment) Examples of promotion documents from previously approved Ops promotions can be found in this Google Drive folder Promotion Document Reviews Team Member and Manager work together to create promotion document. Promotion document is shared with Ops Sub-Department managers in #ops-staff-confidential channel (private to Ops Managers, Senior Managers, Director) to receive feedback on the document content and how it calibrates with others in the Sub-Department. This can be done early and often. Manager requests another Manager in the Sub-Department review and approve the document. Manager requests Senior Manager in the Sub-Department review and approve the document. Manager requests Director add Team Member to list of Sub-Department planned promotions. If the team member cannot be added Director will provide feedback to Manager as to why. Director presents promotion doc at Development Department quarterly promotion review meeting. If the promotion is not approved Director will provide feedback to Manager as to why. Quarterly Promotion Review Meeting Ops Managers, Sr. Managers, and Directors meet in the last month of each quarter to: Review promotion projections for each group. Managers add a list of their direct reports who they anticipate will be ready for promotion in the next 3 quarters to the meeting agenda. Note these lists may change and are not a guarantee a team member will be promoted in a specific quarter. The lists are used for planning purposes, to help us anticipate the number of team members approaching promotion, budget impact, and to support calibration across the group. These lists should include: Team Member name Targeted promotion quarter",

These lists should include: Team Member name Targeted promotion quarter Link to promotion doc Whether the doc has received any Ops Manager or Ops Senior Manager approvals. Review Ops team member promotion docs planned to be presented at Development Department quarterly promotion review meeting. Promotion Mentor for Staff+ Roles Team members who aspire to advance within our organization are advised to identify a mentor in the targeted role, and reach out to them about a mentorship. Involving a mentor in the peer promotion review process is beneficial, as it ensures: The feedback is informed by comprehensive understanding and relevance to the individual’s development. The feedback, being familiar and constructive, will not catch the mentee off guard and will provide clear directions for improvement from peers they’d work with directly. Individuals pursuing promotion, possibly in consultation with their managers, should maintain regular communication with their mentor to evaluate progress and explore further opportunities for growth. This initiative also aims to cultivate leadership qualities among our senior Staff+ engineers. We plan to trial this optional process in Ops during Q1FY25. Progress and established mentor/mentee pairs can be found in this epic Ops Hiring process We have limited capacity in the recruiting team so hiring managers are experimenting with the Ops Hiring process. We also hold a weekly hiring manager sync meeting (see Meetings section). Objectives & Key Results (OKRs) Creating OKRs Target a 70% completion rate for OKRs so that we are setting goals ambitiously. They should be challenging enough that accomplishing 100% is a stretch goal,since GitLab considers OKRs to be stretch goals by default. If your OKRs are associated with any specific types of issues, consider reviewing the prioritization framework, and align with your team on your OKRs priority relative to one another (for example, OKRs with issues with “forced prioritization”) and be clear on planning of the associated work over the quarter. Ensure Key Results (KRs) are measurable, by specifying a number (% or unit) as the target. Be clear on the starting number, and the expected end result (e.g. from x to y). Ideally create no more than 9 KRs per quarter, ideally with approximately 3 KR per objective. Tracking and completing OKRs Tracking quarterly OKRs for Ops Engineering groups. DRIs are expected to score OKRs on a regular basis, at least monthly, if possible. At the end of the quarter, DRIs can add a retrospective as a comment to reflect on the progress of their KR, in the following format: **Good** - Things that went well... **Bad** - Things that didn't go so well... **Try** - What might you do differently next time? Key Projects For projects that span many milestones we are experimenting with additional project management processes.

Project plans should (roughly) follow this format (from https://www.rubick.com/weekly-project-plans/): Weekly project plan template Week of Jan 4th Single chart shows up in Slack. Data is canned. Schedule risk: we're validating our list of chart types are all technically feasible. We'll demo outcome of that investigation. Week of Jan 11th Chart data reflects live information, and is functional in Slack chart. Additional chart type shows in Slack room, with most basic visual design. We've shown to at least one alpha customer for feedback. We start sharing with them every week from here on out. Jessica is on-call and doing interrupt-driven work for week. Week of Jan 18th Most important feedback from alpha customers incorporated. Other work is prioritized to future milestones. Last chart type added. Week of Jan 25th Holiday Jan 26th. Charts look great and are thoroughly tested, instrumented. We'll show usage dashboards. Release end of week. Updates to the plan should be made weekly, marking",

    "content": "are listed as key projects should create these project planning artifacts: Project Plan in the handbook under /engineering/devops/ops/project-plans/<project_name>/index.html.md.erb Since the project plan is stored in the handbook it is easy to track changes in the project plan and see how it evolves over time. Project plans should (roughly) follow this format (from https://www.rubick.com/weekly-project-plans/): Weekly project plan template Week of Jan 4th Single chart shows up in Slack. Data is canned. Schedule risk: we're validating our list of chart types are all technically feasible. We'll demo outcome of that investigation. Week of Jan 11th Chart data reflects live information, and is functional in Slack chart. Additional chart type shows in Slack room, with most basic visual design. We've shown to at least one alpha customer for feedback. We start sharing with them every week from here on out. Jessica is on-call and doing interrupt-driven work for week. Week of Jan 18th Most important feedback from alpha customers incorporated. Other work is prioritized to future milestones. Last chart type added. Week of Jan 25th Holiday Jan 26th. Charts look great and are thoroughly tested, instrumented. We'll show usage dashboards. Release end of week. Updates to the plan should be made weekly, marking weekly items done and making updates based on current information. Authors should merge updates to their project plans without review/approval. We expect the use of project plans to reduce the amount of EM reporting by serving as a SSOT for project execution planning. For example this info no longer needs to be included in async updates (replace with a link to project plan). Key Project Review Meetings We hold periodic sync meetings to review key projects and collaborate on the plans for these important deliverables. Key Project DRIs should prepare for the meeting by creating a Key Project Review Prep Issue. This should be completed and shared at least 48 hours in advance of the meeting to allow time for other team members to review the content. The objective is to keep these meetings focused on execution, technical planning, and accountability within the Engineering group. These are open to anyone who wishes to attend. When it’s necessary to involve a broader group in some cases, we can plan additional follow ups case by case. We aim to meet synchronously where possible given the benefits of being able to talk through the project in a higher bandwidth context. Rescheduling is preferred if the proposed dates are not feasible for attendees. We could re-evaluate whether we can achieve the same goals with async after we have more experience running the process. The focus of the meeting time will be on topics such as: Do we all understand the goals, plan, and timeline? Obstacles/risks and mitigation plans Unmet dependencies Staffing levels Competing priorities How to unblock and/or accelerate Recognizing progress and key team member contributions Async Updates (No Status In Meetings) We have a policy in Ops to keep status updates out of meetings. Instead of reporting on status in meetings Directors, Senior Engineering Managers, Engineering Managers and Principal Engineers provide regular async updates. The content of these updates varies by individual and role: Async Update Guidance Engineering Manager Cadence: Weekly to Monthly (Optional) Topics: Highlights & Accomplishments Team Projects & Priorities (progress, blockers, key decisions, etc.) What’s next - what to expect in next update Senior Engineering Manager Cadence: Monthly (Optional) Topics: Milestone Review Allocation of focus in milestone plans (major features, maintenance, etc.) What tradeoffs or decisions should be made prior to Milestone kickoff? For example: Is the team overcommitted? Does the allocation of effort need to shift to meet specific goals? (e.g. Security SLAs) Principal Engineer Cadence: Weekly (Optional) Topics: Highlights & Accomplishments Projects & Priorities (progress, blockers, key decisions, etc.) To create a weekly async update Create a GitLab issue in any project. Apply the label ~OpsSection::AsyncUpdate. (The label ~OpsSection::Weekly-Update can also be used for backwards compatibility reasons.) Choose a descriptive title. Include your update in the issue description. To HIGHLIGHT an item for broader sharing Begin any paragraph in your update with the text HIGHLIGHT: These paragraphs will automatically be copied into the Highlights & Accomplishments section of the monthly Director’s update. To review Ops weekly async updates All issues with the ~OpsSection::AsyncUpdate or ~OpsSection::Weekly-Update label are summarized in weekly issues in the Ops Status Updates project. All team members are encouraged to comment and ask questions in weekly async update issues. This provides useful feedback to the author and opportunities to collaborate. Director reviews all updates weekly (from the prior week) and provides feedback. Senior EMs reviews all updates from their teams weekly (from the prior week) and provides feedback. Benefits of reporting and reviewing status async vs. synchronously in meetings Collaboration - By sharing announcements, achievements, goals, and plans we are empowering team members with the information they need to make sound decisions and succeed in their roles. Results - Async updates provide an important channel for sharing accomplishments and progress. Efficiency - Expecting each team member to poll for the status they need is extremely inefficient and becomes more inefficient as the organization grows. By using a Publish Subscribe model we are able to share information much more efficiently. Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging - Async status is more inclusive of team members across timezones. Not every team member will be able to make a sync meeting (due to timezone or other factors) but everyone can participate in an async update. Iteration - Taking the time to checkpoint where we are at each week prompts the author and readers to consider ways to iterate and to reflect on incremental progress. Transparency - Sharing information in a consistent, accessible way increases transparency and reduces the threshold for team members to contribute. Escalations from Support Team We are piloting a process to make coordinating with the Support team on customer escalations more efficient.

Supporting Customers on Dedicated instances When teams are asked to triage support requests for customers on GitLab Dedicated and engineers need access to their logs, a sync can be arranged between the engineer and the assigned Support Engineer for a screen sharing session. However, when further troubleshooting is needed by the engineering team or async collaboration is preferred, follow these steps to request access: Create an access request (AR) and list the engineers who require access. (Note that EMs can create this issue and provide Manager Approval on behalf of the engineers) Assign the AR to the EM and PM of the Dedicated group for read-only log access. Reference the AR issue in the support tracker issue so that the Support Engineer is aware.

    "content": "Verify:Pipeline Execution Group The GitLab team page for the Pipeline Execution Group. This team maps to Verify DevOps stage and supports the Continuous Integration use case. Vision For an understanding of what this team is going to be working on take a look at the product vision. This team is responsible for delivering on the following directions: Continuous Integration Merge Trains Mission Make software development easier, faster, and more reliable by creating and supporting a Continuous Integration product that is performant, scalable, and lovable. The Verify:Pipeline Execution Group is focused on supporting the functionality with respect to Continuous Integration. A key focus for the PE group is delivering features that achieve the outcome we track in our performance indicator. Driving Factors Performance Improving perceived performance from a customer perspective. For example, responsive UIs, reduced time to results. Reducing processing time in Pipeline Execution owned code. Ensuring the reliably of results. For example, return results to web requests in a timely manner (overlaps with scalability). Scalability Supporting a lot of customers. Supporting a single customer with a large and/or complex set up. Developer Efficiency Reducing the complexity of the codebase. Dealing with the breadth of the code owned by the team. Reducing length of time it takes to get an MR through the review process. Ensuring efficiency related to Community Contributions; Ensuring that issues are approachable by the community. Improving efficiency in the review process for community contributions. Customer Experience Ensuring that customer issues are resolved in a timely manner. Addressing SUSImpacting issues in a timely manner. Ensuring reliable and accurate documentation is available. Performance Indicator We measure the value we contribute by using Performance Indicators (PI), which we define and use to track progress. The current PI for the Pipeline Execution group is the number of unique users who trigger ci_pipelines. For more details, please check out the Product Team Performance Indicators. To view the latest Verify stage ci_pipeline data see our Tableau Dashboard. Usage Funnel Based on the AARRR framework (Acquisition, Activation, Retention, Revenue, Referral), this funnel represents the customer journey in using GitLab CI. Each state in the funnel is defined with a metric to measure behavior. Product managers can focus on any of the various states in the funnel to prioritize features that drive a desired action. classDiagram Acquistion --|> Activation Acquistion: Awareness - Are users aware of CI pipelines? Acquistion: Measurement (Total count of users in GitLab Projects with access to `git write` or \"SCM Users\") Activation --|> Retention Activation: Use - Are users creating CI configurations/pipelines? Activation: Measurement (Total count of projects with .gitlab-ci.yml files) Retention --|> Revenue Retention: Continued use - Are users triggering CI pipelines? Retention: Measurement (Total count of projects with a .gitlab-ci.yml file and CI pipeline triggered) Revenue --|> Referral Revenue: Monetary value - Are users paying for the CI features?

As with any of our goals, they are ambitious and subject to change. Performance Pipeline Speed Goals: Understand what we can do to improve pipeline speed Prototype at least one big swing improvement Fix Long Standing Pipeline Status Issues Goals: Deep dive into existing pipeline status issues and code Determine if there are and make systemic changes to address a number of the issues Scalability Sidekiq Goals: Improve performance of our background workers to increase reliability and scalability Support Improved Job Searching Capabilities Goals: Improve our ability to support additional search and filtering capabilities for jobs Reduce Operating costs Goals: Contribute to data retention planning Identify potential cost savings from compressing job logs - Spike Depending on results, schedule work to implement compression Developer Efficiency Technical Debt Reduction Goals: Reduce the overall technical debt existing within the codebase Avoid accumulating more long-term debt by scheduling follow-up issues promptly Frontend Refactoring to Vue Goals: Complete the refactoring of the pipeline subscriptions pages to Vue Identify any additional areas that should be refactored Epic Pipeline Rendering Goals: Complete performance improvements for pipeline page rendering. This functionality is used frequently by developers and their productivity is impacted by poor performance. Merge Trains Goals: Get merge trains to a state where they are scalable enough to be used effectively by the GitLab project. Team Members Name Role Additional Team Responsibilities These roles/responsibilities will be assigned to team members on a rotating basis to ensure we spread the load across the full team, and no individual has undue hardship by being the only “go-to” person for any of these tasks.

Team Members Name Role Additional Team Responsibilities These roles/responsibilities will be assigned to team members on a rotating basis to ensure we spread the load across the full team, and no individual has undue hardship by being the only “go-to” person for any of these tasks. Front-line Responder This team member will have the following responsibilities for the milestone (in priority order) and will not have any assigned ~Deliverable items: Respond to broken-master alerts for Pipeline Execution. DRI for any incoming help requests from support. Existing help requests may be transferred to them at the discretion of the existing DRI. They are free to pull in others as needed to address the request, but remain the DRI for ensuring the requests are addressed. First developer pulled into customer escalations unless there is an obvious reason to choose another team member. [Optional] Organize and host a weekly swarm meeting to work on help requests with additional team members. Respond to incoming questions in slack in #pipeline-execution and #s-verify (where related to Pipeline Execution). They can redirect to other team members as they deem necessary. The important part is to ensure we are responsive. Investigate error budget overages. Additional maintenance tasks (in suggested priority order): Address flaky tests as time permits. Work on long-standing maintenance issues as time permits. Example, we have a long list of very old feature flags that need to be addressed. Refinement of ~“type::maintenance” issues in ~“cicd::planning” as time permits. Any other ~“type::maintenance” issues in ~“cicd::active” as time permits. For any of the above tasks, when an urgent issue arises outside of the team members working hours, other team members will need to be the first responders. The milestone’s Front-line Responder will be responsible for following up on such issues during their working hours. They are not expected to be on-call 24/7 during the milestone. At the end of the milestone, any issues that are still ongoing, may be transitioned to the incoming First Responder. If it makes sense for the original team member to continue being the DRI, this can also be done. Community Coordinator This team member will have the following responsibilities for the milestone in addition to their ~Deliverable task: Do a first pass over any new community contributions as identified in the weekly Verify Pipeline teams: Community contributions report to ensure they seem like they are on the right track. Rotation Schedule Program Paused Milestone Front-line Responder Community Coordinator Stable Counterparts To find our stable counterparts, look at the Pipeline Execution product category listing. Technologies Like most GitLab backend teams we spend a lot of time working in Rails on the main GitLab CE app, but we also do a lot of work in Go which is the language that GitLab Runner is written in. Familiarity with Docker and Kubernetes is also useful on our team.

How We Work The Pipeline Execution Workflow board is the source of truth for current and upcoming work. Planning Our planning timeline follows the GitLab Product Development timeline. For information about Engineering Time see Engineering Initiatives. PM (with help from EM as needed) will curate the list of Candidate::x.x + not Engineering Time list to ensure there is a reasonable number of high priority issues to select from at any point. If there are no issues for the milestone you are looking for you may select from a future milestone. EM (with help from PM as needed) will maintain the list of Engineering Time + Candidate::x.x issues to ensure there is a reasonable number of high priority issues to select from at any point. If there are no issues for the milestone you are looking for you may select from a future milestone. By the Friday 2 weeks before the end of the current milestone each Engineer will: Ensure the milestone on your current issue reflects the milestone you believe it will be completed based on the latest knowledge Note: Any issues you have in progress that will not be completed in the current milestone can be used in lieu of selecting a new issue as long as the criteria matches If you are unsure if the issues you have in progress are still a priority check with the EM and PM to verify. Update the ~Deliverable or ~Stretch label if there is one if necessary Select 1 Candidate::x.x + not Engineering Time issue that you will work on in the upcoming milestone.

EM (with help from PM as needed) will maintain the list of Engineering Time + Candidate::x.x issues to ensure there is a reasonable number of high priority issues to select from at any point. If there are no issues for the milestone you are looking for you may select from a future milestone. By the Friday 2 weeks before the end of the current milestone each Engineer will: Ensure the milestone on your current issue reflects the milestone you believe it will be completed based on the latest knowledge Note: Any issues you have in progress that will not be completed in the current milestone can be used in lieu of selecting a new issue as long as the criteria matches If you are unsure if the issues you have in progress are still a priority check with the EM and PM to verify. Update the ~Deliverable or ~Stretch label if there is one if necessary Select 1 Candidate::x.x + not Engineering Time issue that you will work on in the upcoming milestone. Start with ~priority::1 issues first followed by ~priority::2 and ~priority::3 Assign yourself Assure there is a weight set Set the milestone according to the milestone when you expect the work to complete If it is not the upcoming milestone, break the issue into multiple issues, one of which can be completed in the upcoming milestone if at all possible. Let the EM/PM know you have done this in an issue comment on the original issue so they can ensure the rest of the issues are planned for appropriately. Add the Deliverable label. Select 1 flaky-test issue to fix. Do a quick check to see if there are multiple issues that are clearly caused by the same issue, link these as related and/or assign to themselves. Set the milestone appropriately to indicate when the test will be fixed. If you are unsure of the timeline, you can delay setting the milestone until you are comfortable committing to a milestone. Select 1 item to weight and refine for upcoming work Assign this item to yourself. You can unassign it once you have completed the refinement process. You may want to add a comment indicating that you are assigning to yourself for refinement purposes only, so there is no confusion. This is entirely optional. Do not set a milestone on the issue. If refinement is going to take considerable effort, create a refinement “~spike” issue (see also Spikes and Steps for Refining and Weighting Issues) Tag the EM in a comment on the spike to let them know you have created this spike. Use this as your Engineering Time item for the milestone. Select 1 item to weight and refine for community contribution Assign this item to yourself.

Add a comment to the milestone planning issue to indicate which issues that you have completed this planning work and the issues you have selected. Throughout the milestone, if an Engineer completes their tasks and has extra capacity: checkout What do I work on next By the Monday the week the milestone ends: Planning issue is finalized and PM will tag manager, SET/QEM, Product Design, engineers, and EM for review and feedback. By the Friday the milestone ends: Engineers should comment on the planning issue with any changes to their planned work. PM completes monthly kick-off video featuring ~direction and Deliverable issues By the Monday of release week: The EM will ensure that labels are set correctly for any milestone issues Note: The EM and PM may need to modify the team commitments and schedule work for the upcoming milestone as we focus on Customer Results over what we plan. How Engineering Refines Issues side note: we prefer using Refining over Grooming Engineers are expected to allocate approximately 6 hours each milestone to refine and weight issues on the ~needs weight board. The purpose of refining an issue is to ensure the problem statement is clear enough to provide a rough effort sizing estimate; the intention is not to provide solution validation during refinement. When refining issues, engineers should timebox the activity to no more than 2 hours per issue. If an issue is complex and will require more research, we should track that effort in a refinement “~spike” to ensure we account for it in milestone planning. The “~spike” should be linked as blocking the original issue and outline the outcomes expected and a timebox for the effort should be specified. The original issue should be labeled as “~workflow::blocked”. Engineering uses the following handbook guidance for determining weights. If any issue needs any additional ~frontend ~backend ~Quality ~UX ~documentation reviews, they are assigned to the respective individual(s).

How Engineering Refines Issues side note: we prefer using Refining over Grooming Engineers are expected to allocate approximately 6 hours each milestone to refine and weight issues on the ~needs weight board. The purpose of refining an issue is to ensure the problem statement is clear enough to provide a rough effort sizing estimate; the intention is not to provide solution validation during refinement. When refining issues, engineers should timebox the activity to no more than 2 hours per issue. If an issue is complex and will require more research, we should track that effort in a refinement “~spike” to ensure we account for it in milestone planning. The “~spike” should be linked as blocking the original issue and outline the outcomes expected and a timebox for the effort should be specified. The original issue should be labeled as “~workflow::blocked”. Engineering uses the following handbook guidance for determining weights. If any issue needs any additional ~frontend ~backend ~Quality ~UX ~documentation reviews, they are assigned to the respective individual(s). Checklist for Refining Issues Does the issue have a problem statement in the description? Does the issue have the expected behaviour described well enough for anyone to understand? Does the issue explicitly define who the stakeholders are (e.g. BE, FE, PM, UX and/or Tech Writer)? Does the issue have a proposal in the description? If so: Does the proposal address the problem statement? Are there any unintended side effects of the implementation? Does the issue have proper labeling matching the job to be done? (e.g. bug, feature, performance) Any one on the team can contribute to answering the questions in this checklist, but the final decisions are up to the PM and EMs. Steps for Refining and Weighting Issues Engineers will: Go through the checklist above for refining issues assigned to them. Split a backend issue out from the main issue if backend work needs to be completed before frontend work can begin. Add a weight based on the definitions. Update the ~workflow:: label to the appropriate status, e.g. ~“workflow::design” if further design refinement is needed, and let the designer know. ~“workflow::ready for development” when refinement is completed and a weight has been applied, signaling that it’s ready for implementation and the issue can now be prioritized ~“workflow::blocked” if more investigation and research is needed. Create a refinement “~spike” issue and ping the PM and EM. Remove the “~needs weight” label if weighting was completed. Unassign themselves from the issue when they are done refining and weighting the issue. Timeboxing Issue Refinement Because we should not be spending more than 2 hours per issue, we should re-evaluate if more time is needed or if a spike is required based on If the issue is still reproducible on GitLab.com. If the cause is not obvious, a good first step is to ask the author for clarifications. If Support engagement is present in the issue. We can tell if the issue is created by a GitLab team member or if it has the ~customer label. If the issue is on GitLab.com or if it’s on a self-managed instance. If this only affects self-managed instance, we can ask for request for help issue instead. The scope and affect of the issue. If it’s only affecting one customer or if it’s present for multiple customers A good general rule is to look at the P* levels. P1 issues should be refined as they’ll be immediately worked on in the next milestone. P2 and P3 can spin off spike issues if more time is needed. Weighting Issues The team makes use of the ~needs weight board that shows issues that need to be weighted for upcoming milestones. The criteria are denoted by having a ~needs weight and ~cicd::planning applied. Throughout the month, team members review the ~needs weight board and assign issues to themselves. The priority order will be determined by column: Verify::P1, Verify::P2, Verify::P3, then ‘Open’. If there is an issue with a higher urgency for weighting, a team member might be directly assigned to the issue for a prioritized review. We add a Weight to issues as a way to estimate the effort needed to complete an issue. We factor in complexity and any additional coordination needed to work on an issue. We weight issues based on complexity, following the fibonacci sequence: Weight Description 1: Trivial The problem is very well understood, no extra investigation is required, the exact solution is already known and just needs to be implemented, no surprises are expected, and no coordination with other teams or people is required.Examples are documentation updates, simple regressions, and other bugs that have already been investigated and discussed and can be fixed with a few lines of code, or technical debt that we know exactly how to address, but just haven’t found time for yet. Around 1 MR to address 2: Small The problem is well understood and a solution is outlined, but a little bit of extra investigation will probably still be required to realize the solution. Few surprises are expected, if any, and no coordination with other teams or people is required.Examples are simple features, like a new API endpoint to expose existing data or functionality, or regular bugs or performance issues where some investigation has already taken place. Less than 2 MRs to address 3: Medium Features that are well understood and relatively straightforward. A solution will be outlined, and some edge cases will be considered, but additional investigation may be required to confirm the approach. Some surprises are expected, and coordination with other team members may be necessary.Bugs that are relatively well understood, but additional investigation may be required. The expectation is that once the problem is verified and major edge cases have been identified, a solution should be relatively straightforward.Examples are regular features, potentially with backend or frontend dependencies or performance issues. 3 or more MRs to address 5: Large Features that are well understood, but has more ambiguity and complexity. A solution will be outlined, and major edge",

A solution will be outlined, and major edge cases will be considered, but additional investigation will likely be required to validate the approach. Surprises with specific edge cases are to be expected, and feedback from multiple engineers and/or teams may be required.Bugs are complex and may be understood, and may not have an in depth solution defined during issue refinement. Additional investigation is likely necessary, and once the problem is identified, multiple iterations of a solution may be considered.Examples are large features with backend and frontend dependencies, or performance issues that have a solution outlined but requires more in depth solution validation. Unknown amount of MRs to address, must be broken down. The maximum weighted value for an issue is a 5, and may exceed one milestone to complete given additional dependencies and/or complexity. Consider how an issue weighted with a 5 can be broken down into smaller iterations and do so. A feature flag roll-out issue should be created while refining/weighting where anticipated. These are weight of 1. Release Plans To encourage more transparency and collaboration amongst the team and additionally align on the Release Posts we publish at the end of each milestone, we will be creating a separate issue to highlight a Feature flag roll out plan for each feature being released starting in 13.2, based on the issue template for feature flag roll outs. The engineer who implements the feature will be responsible for creating this separate issue to highlight the details of when and how the feature flag will be toggled, and subsequently link this issue to their feature issue. The product manager will tag this issue as a blocker to their release post, so that everyone is aligned on the release plan of the feature. Prioritization of issues The team makes use of Verify::P* labels to indicate priority order of issues. As part of milestone planning and review we may decide to change or remove the labels to reflect new priority for issues. Currently these labels are applied as follows. Priority Label Reason for applying Verify::P1 These are issues are the highest priority within their priority::x grouping. Verify::P2 These are issues are the second highest priority within their priority::x grouping. Verify::P3 These are issues are the third highest priority within their priority::x grouping. Workflow We use the Pipeline Execution Workflow issue board to track what we work on in the current milestone. Development moves through workflow states in the following order: workflow::design (if applicable) workflow::planning breakdown workflow::ready for development workflow::in dev workflow::blocked (as necessary) workflow::in review workflow::verification workflow::awaiting security release (if applicable) workflow::feature-flagged (if applicable) workflow::complete Closed workflow::planning breakdown is driven by Product, but is a collaborative effort between Product and Engineering. The steps for planning breakdown typically consists of: Product defining or clarifying the problem statement. Product will collaborate on problem validation as needed. Engineering clarifying the issue description as stated. Then refining and weighting the issue. If there is not enough information to do so, the PM should be tagged on the issue and the workflow state should be set to workflow::problem validation. At any point, if an issue becomes blocked, it would be in the workflow::blocked status. If there is a blocking issue, it needs to be added to the issue description or linked to the issue with a ‘blocked by’ relationship. If there is not a blocking issue, the reason for being blocked should be clearly communicated in a comment on the issue. workflow::ready for development means that an issue has been sufficiently refined and weighted by Engineering. Issues in this state that are labeled cicd::active are ones that should be worked on in a milestone. When a developer starts working on an issue they should set the milestone to that of the one where the issue will most likely be completed, rather than the one where it is started. workflow::awaiting security release is applied by an engineer after the security issue has passed verification and this label signals that it is ready for production but awaiting the next monthly security release. When this label is applied, the issue’s milestone should also be updated to the next milestone to align with when the next security release will happen. workflow::feature-flagged is applied to an issue that is being enabled through a separate feature flag rollout issue. Once the feature is validated the status is moved to workflow::complete and the issue is closed. Closed means that all code changes associated with the issue are fully enabled on gitlab.com. If it is being rolled out behind a feature flag, it means the feature flag is enabled for all users on gitlab.com. More detail on the workflow is available on the Product-Development Flow page. “What do I work on next?” check with your team members to see if they need help to complete their committed work.

    "content": "developer starts working on an issue they should set the milestone to that of the one where the issue will most likely be completed, rather than the one where it is started. workflow::awaiting security release is applied by an engineer after the security issue has passed verification and this label signals that it is ready for production but awaiting the next monthly security release. When this label is applied, the issue’s milestone should also be updated to the next milestone to align with when the next security release will happen. workflow::feature-flagged is applied to an issue that is being enabled through a separate feature flag rollout issue. Once the feature is validated the status is moved to workflow::complete and the issue is closed. Closed means that all code changes associated with the issue are fully enabled on gitlab.com. If it is being rolled out behind a feature flag, it means the feature flag is enabled for all users on gitlab.com. More detail on the workflow is available on the Product-Development Flow page. “What do I work on next?” check with your team members to see if they need help to complete their committed work. See Working Right to Left to reduce WIP check with the EM or PM to see if there are any customer support requests you can help with. consult the lists used in planning to find additional unclaimed items to work on. What are the priorities for this milestone? We use a series of labels to indicate the highest priority issues in the milestone. The highest priorities for a given milestone would be issues labeled with Verify::P1, Deliverable, and group::pipeline execution to align with the Theme and Goals of the milestone. Each milestone will start with 1 issue per engineer, which will be labeled as Deliverable, and group::pipeline execution. This should account for approximately 30% of the average total milestone weight. Once all of the Verify::P1 issues have been picked up and are in workflow:in dev or beyond, we have Verify::P2 and Verify::P3 to signal issues that are important and will likely become Verify::P1 issues in later milestones. Following the priorities, the lists used in planning will be curated, so that each team member can pull items from these lists as they choose according to capacity. Setting the Milestone When DRIs select issues, they will assign themselves to the issue and also add the milestone that they believe the issue will most likely be shipped, which may not be the current milestone. The DRI may work on issues which are in future milestones. If the milestone is set to a future milestone or not set, and you are sure it will be shipped in the current milestone, reset the milestone to the current one. This is also a good time to re-evaluate the weight and proposal, especially if the DRI picking up the issue was not the same individual who originally weighted and refined the issue. Aspirationally, we strive to iterate and want to break down the efforts to ship as much value in the milestone for our users as possible. This means if you see a more efficient way forward when you start working on a new issue, you are free to raise a comment and update the proposal to deliver more iterative value. Working Right to Left to reduce WIP Each member of the team can choose which issues to work on during a milestone by assigning the issue to themselves. When the milestone is well underway and we find ourselves looking for work, we default to working right to left on the issue board by pulling issues in the right-most column. If there is an issue that a team member can help with on the board, they should do so instead of starting new work. This includes conducting code review on issues that the team member may not be assigned to, if they feel that they can add value and help move the issue along to completion. Additionally, prior to picking up the next issue from the top of the workflow::ready for development column, team members should check the ~needs weight board to ensure candidates for upcoming milestones have been weighted. Specifically, this means our work is prioritized in the following order: Any verification on code that is in workflow::verification or workflow::production Conducting code reviews on issues that are workflow::in review Unblocking anyone in workflow::blocked or workflow::in dev if applicable Check the ~needs weight board for any issues needing to be weighted in current milestone. Then, picking from the top of the workflow::ready for development column The goal of this process is to reduce the amount of work in progress (WIP) at any given time. Reducing WIP forces us to “Start less, finish more”, and it also reduces cycle time. Engineers should keep in mind that the DRI for a merge request is the author(s), to reflect the importance of teamwork without diluting the notion that having a DRI is encouraged by our values. Splitting issues If an issue has several components (e.g. ~frontend, ~backend, or ~documentation) it may be useful to split it up into separate implementation issues. The original issue should hold all the discussion around the feature, with the implementation issues being used to track the work done. If implementation will take more than 1 milestone and/or none of the implementation will be done against the original issue, it should be promoted to an epic. Doing this provides several benefits: There’s only one DRI per issue. Workflow labels and health statuses are more relevant. We can weight issues with more accuracy. We can mark one implementation as a blocker for another. It’s easier to see what work can be picked up by each functional group. We can schedule feature work across multiple milestones. When moving an issue through workflow::design to workflow::planning breakdown and implementation, use one of these processes: Frontend? Backend? Action Yes Yes Original issue is renamed to a Frontend implementation issue and a separate Backend implementation issue is created.",

    "content": "mind that the DRI for a merge request is the author(s), to reflect the importance of teamwork without diluting the notion that having a DRI is encouraged by our values. Splitting issues If an issue has several components (e.g. ~frontend, ~backend, or ~documentation) it may be useful to split it up into separate implementation issues. The original issue should hold all the discussion around the feature, with the implementation issues being used to track the work done. If implementation will take more than 1 milestone and/or none of the implementation will be done against the original issue, it should be promoted to an epic. Doing this provides several benefits: There’s only one DRI per issue. Workflow labels and health statuses are more relevant. We can weight issues with more accuracy. We can mark one implementation as a blocker for another. It’s easier to see what work can be picked up by each functional group. We can schedule feature work across multiple milestones. When moving an issue through workflow::design to workflow::planning breakdown and implementation, use one of these processes: Frontend? Backend? Action Yes Yes Original issue is renamed to a Frontend implementation issue and a separate Backend implementation issue is created. No Yes Original issue is renamed to a Backend implementation issue. Yes No Original issue is renamed to a Frontend implementation issue. If an issue in workflow::design is too large in scope to be effectively implemented in one issue, or in case the issue is old and too cluttered with discussions, the issue can be broken down into smaller issues. The Product Designer will work together with the Engineers and the Product Manager during workflow::design to understand the possible iteration plan and break down the large design proposal into smaller parts whenever possible. When new implementation issues are created, they should always be linked to the initial issue that contains the proposal and relevant discussions. Please use implementation issues responsibly. They make sense for larger issues, but can be cumbersome for smaller features. Weekly Issue Progress Updates In order to keep our stakeholders informed of work in progress, we provide updates to issues either by updating the issue’s health status and/or adding an async issue update. Issue Health Status For issues in the current milestone, we use the Issue Health Status feature to indicate probability that an issue will ship in the current milestone. This status is updated by the DRI (directly responsible individual) as soon as they recognize the probability has changed. If there is no change to the status, a comment to indicate that it has been the status of the issue has been assessed would be helpful. The following are definitions of the health status options: On Track - The issue has no current blockers, and is likely to be completed in the current milestone. Needs Attention - The issue is still likely to be completed in the current milestone, but there are setbacks or time constraints that could cause the issue to miss the release due dates. At Risk - The issue is highly unlikely to be completed in the current milestone, and will probably miss the release due dates. Examples of how status updates are added: If the health status changes from On Track to Needs attention or At Risk, we recommend that the DRI add a short comment stating the reason for the change in an issue status update. If an issue continues to be On Track, the DRI could provide a comment to indicate solutions (whatever it may be) continue to be implemented, and it’s still on track to be delivered in the same milestone. Issue status updates When the DRI is actively working on an issue (workflow status is workflow::in dev, ~workflow::in review, or workflow::verification in the current milestone), they will add a comment into the issue with a status update, detailing: the updated issue health status notes on what was done based on the updated issue health status (especially if not On Track) anything else the DRI feels is beneficial to reflect the progress There are several benefits to this approach: Team members can better identify what they can do to help the issue move along the board Creates an opening for other team members to engage and collaborate if they have ideas Leaving a status update is a good prompt to ask questions and start a discussion The wider GitLab community can more easily follow along with product development A history of the roadblocks the issue encountered is readily available in case of retrospection Product and Engineering Managers are more easily able to keep informed of the progress of work Expectations for DRIs when providing updates for work in progress: Status updates are provided once per week, barring special circumstances (e.g. PTO) Ideally updates are made at a logical part of a DRI’s workflow to minimize disruption, and not necessarily at the same time/day each week Generally when there is a logical time to leave an update, such as a change in issue health status, that is the best time to do so Can be used to present some technical findings or information relevant to other stakeholders Tracking Inactive Issues As a general rule, any issues being actively worked on have one of the following workflow labels: workflow::in dev workflow::in review workflow::verification workflow::complete (upon closing the issue) The Health Status of these issues should be updated to: Needs Attention - on the 1st of the month. At Risk - on the 8th of the month. EMs are responsible for manually updating the Health Status of any inactive issues in the milestone accordingly. Spikes Spikes are time-boxed investigations typically performed in agile software development. We create Spike issues when there is uncertainty on how to proceed on a feature from a technical perspective before a feature is developed. Guidelines Spikes are typically marked as deliverable to ensure clear ownership from engineers Spikes are typically time-boxed to a short duration, sometimes one week, never more than one milestone.

    "content": "of a DRI’s workflow to minimize disruption, and not necessarily at the same time/day each week Generally when there is a logical time to leave an update, such as a change in issue health status, that is the best time to do so Can be used to present some technical findings or information relevant to other stakeholders Tracking Inactive Issues As a general rule, any issues being actively worked on have one of the following workflow labels: workflow::in dev workflow::in review workflow::verification workflow::complete (upon closing the issue) The Health Status of these issues should be updated to: Needs Attention - on the 1st of the month. At Risk - on the 8th of the month. EMs are responsible for manually updating the Health Status of any inactive issues in the milestone accordingly. Spikes Spikes are time-boxed investigations typically performed in agile software development. We create Spike issues when there is uncertainty on how to proceed on a feature from a technical perspective before a feature is developed. Guidelines Spikes are typically marked as deliverable to ensure clear ownership from engineers Spikes are typically time-boxed to a short duration, sometimes one week, never more than one milestone. We should try to schedule Spikes at the beginning of an iteration so that the investigation will conclude before the planning of the following iteration. Limit no more than 2 Spikes per milestone per group. Typically multiple team members collaborate on a spike. We want to ensure we get multiple different viewpoints as well as keep the research focused and efficient. Spikes should be assigned to at least one frontend and one backend engineer to ensure we consider the issue from both viewpoints. Category Labels The Pipeline Execution group supports the product marketing categories described below: Label Category:Continuous Integration Issues MRs Direction Documentation Category:Merge Trains Issues MRs Direction Documentation Feature Labels Label Description api Issues MRs Issues related to API endpoints for CI features. CI permissions Issues MRs Issues related to CI_JOB_TOKEN and CI authentication Compute minutes Issues MRs All issues and MRs related to how we count continuous integration minutes and calculate usage. Formely ~ci minutes merge requests Issues MRs Issues related to CI functionality within the Merge Request. notifications Issues MRs Issues related to various forms of notifications related to CI features. pipeline analytics Issues MRs Issues related to CI pipeline statistics and dashboards. pipeline processing Issues MRs Issues related to the execution of pipeline jobs, including DAG, child pipelines, and matrix build jobs Other Notable Labels Label Description CI/CD core platform Issues MRs Any issues and merge requests related to CI/CD core domain, either as changes to be made or as observable side effects. onboarding Issues Issues that are helpful for someone onboarding as a new team member. Good for 1st time contributors Issues Issues that are good for first time community contributors, and could similarly be labeled for onboarding Seeking community contributions Issues Issues we would like the wider community to contrbute and may also be labeled Seeking community contributions Developing with Feature Flags When building features that may have high impact the team uses established GitLab guidelines for feature flags. We also ensure we are collaborating with our teammates in customer support and customer success by alerting them to the rollout issue before a feature is enabled. The feature flags introduced by the team still in the code can be found in this table. You can also search all Feature Flags through Sam’s great tool here (prefiltered for pipeline exeuction) Collaboration with UX and Engineering To create a high-quality product that is functional and useful – Engineering, PM and Product Designer work closely together, combine methodologies, and often connect throughout the product development process. They use workflow::design to discuss possible complexities, challenges, and uncover blockers around the proposed solution. Product Designers play a critical role in the product development of user-facing issues. They collaborate with the Engineering and the Product Manager to design the user experience for the features. Once the design solution is proposed, agreed and validated, the Engineering DRI is assigned to implement that design and functionality during the milestone for which the issue is planned. Following the code review guidelines means that we should ensure all MRs with user facing changes are reviewed by a product designer. UX reviews should follow the designer review guidelines as closely as possible to reduce the impact on velocity while maintaining quality. Inclusive Development Our process of planning and development relies heavily on overcommunication rather than any approval gates or automated notification mechanisms. We adhere to the proactive mindset and responsibility of everyone involved to make sure every step in the process is as transparent as it can be. For both planning and building this means direct, cross-functional, and other relevant stakeholders are included early into the process. This ensures everyone is able to contribute to the best of their capabilities, and at the right time in the process. This can include, but is not limited to, GitLab objects, Slack, meetings, and daily stand-ups. Some practical examples of this are: When you open up or begin working on an epic, issue, or merge request, consider if all stakeholders are aware of this or should be updated. If unsure, error on the side of updating rather than keeping silent. When making significant progress make sure this is seen by the relevant stakeholders even if you don’t require immediate feedback by mentioning them rather than relying on automated email notifications. Make their involvement explicit. Note: For issues related to Merge Request experience, always keep the Code Review group in the loop to avoid any technical or Deferred UX from occurring. Refer to the collaboration on merge requests experience page to learn more about the collaboration framework. Note: A good practice when only wanting to inform rather than requesting a direct action from the mentioned stakeholders is to put FYI directly following the @mention handle.

Note: A good practice when only wanting to inform rather than requesting a direct action from the mentioned stakeholders is to put FYI directly following the @mention handle. UX Scorecards A top priority for us is usability, and one way to effectively evaluate our JTBDs is with periodic UX Scorecards. For technical tasks that require infrastructure support, such as a functional cluster or provisioned environment with a .gitlab-ci.yml file, the Product Designer and the Product Manager can work with the Engineering Manager and Quality stable counterparts to craft a project based on the scenarios to test for the JTBDs. Some guidelines for working together in this case: Be sure to schedule at least a full milestone in advance, so there is enough lead time for the stable counterparts Create an overall epic and add issues for task tracking for infrastructure creation Schedule a kick off or record a walkthrough of the scenarios for everyone to have a shared understanding of the JTBD that are being evaluated We are also working on maintaining a library of precreated tasks for contribution from the engineering team in the CI Sample Projects group. These will help avoid having too much overhead from UX Scorecards and Category Maturity Scorecards in the future. Breaking down issues for iteration We follow the steps below to achieve the best results in the shortest time: After user research or customer feedback identifies a user need, and has generated some ideas to meet that need, the Product Designer drives the process of moving those ideas into design proposals involving the PM and the Engineering Team early and often. The UX Definition of Done can be referenced to give counterparts better insight into which steps in the design workflow need to be completed before the MVC can move to the development phase. Depending on our confidence in the proposed solution, we may take those prototypes through user testing to validate if they would solve the original problem. Engineers, the Product Designer, EM and PM can compare and contrast multiple possible engineering approaches to decide which one to work on first based on the scope of the solutions and experience of the team. When a solution is validated and the team has a clear understanding of the effort required, it is time to break the big solution down into smaller issues. This is usually done in the workflow::planning breakdown phase and the whole team (PM, Engineers, Product Designer, QA, and Technical Writer) is involved in the process. They work closely together to find the most technically feasible and smallest feature set to deliver value to early customers and provide feedback for future product development. Check out iteration strategies for help. We aim to design broadly for an epic or full feature at least one milestone ahead of time and then break the big solution into smaller issues to pick up in the next milestones. Suppose working one milestone ahead to design the big solution is not possible. In that case, Engineering and Product Designer will define the first most technically feasible and smallest feature set (MVC) to satisfy early customers that will be implemented in the same milestone. Avoiding crunch times between UX, Product and Engineering Ideally, Product Management and Product Designers aim to work 3 months in advance of Engineering proposals to ensure the problem definition and solution has been adequately validated prior to building. See Validation track for more details. This allows us to come up with the bigger idea ahead of time, and work further with Engineering to break it down into smaller iterations. Ideally, this should be completed before the implementation milestone starts. the Product Designer, PM, and Engineering use the Design phase in the Validation track to talk about complexities and discuss challenges and uncover blockers. Once we are all in agreement, we can move it to the Solution Validation phase. If it is taking more than a week to understand and investigate the technical feasibility for the design solution, update the workflow label to ~workflow::blocked and change the assignee to engineering DRIs until the technical discussion is resolved. If the discussion is expected to go on longer, reducing the chances of the design solution being delivered in the intended milestone, consider creating a spike issue for the discussion that blocks the current issue. Engineers and Product Designers should stay in contact and frequently align throughout the Build track to avoid unplanned changes. Collaborating with the Wider Community on Community Merge Requests For more details on how to contribute to GitLab generally, please see our documentation. Aligning on feature development The Engineering DRI works with the Product Designer throughout the workflow:in dev phase to uncover possible problems with the solution early enough that exhibit unexpected behaviour to what was originally agreed upon. If there are changes to be added that weren’t agreed upon in the initial issue - a followup issue should be made and the Engineering DRI should work with the Product Manager to schedule that issue in a following milestone. This allows us to focus on cleanup over signoff, iterate quickly",

    "content": "is taking more than a week to understand and investigate the technical feasibility for the design solution, update the workflow label to ~workflow::blocked and change the assignee to engineering DRIs until the technical discussion is resolved. If the discussion is expected to go on longer, reducing the chances of the design solution being delivered in the intended milestone, consider creating a spike issue for the discussion that blocks the current issue. Engineers and Product Designers should stay in contact and frequently align throughout the Build track to avoid unplanned changes. Collaborating with the Wider Community on Community Merge Requests For more details on how to contribute to GitLab generally, please see our documentation. Aligning on feature development The Engineering DRI works with the Product Designer throughout the workflow:in dev phase to uncover possible problems with the solution early enough that exhibit unexpected behaviour to what was originally agreed upon. If there are changes to be added that weren’t agreed upon in the initial issue - a followup issue should be made and the Engineering DRI should work with the Product Manager to schedule that issue in a following milestone. This allows us to focus on cleanup over signoff, iterate quickly on issues with a low level of shame, and still make sure we accomplish what we’ve agreed upon. We should be careful not to hold off on completing these followup issues so that we don’t build up a significant amount of Deferred UX issues. If we find that solutions are consistently not matching the agreed upon design, we will hold a retrospective with the DRI, designer, and product manager to discuss where the gaps in communication are so that we can improve. It may be necessary to begin requiring a UX approval for merge requests on certain issues to help the Engineering DRI meet the requirements. Collaborating with other Product Groups at GitLab We strive to be as collaborative as possible in our work because the scope of our product area touches many other groups, including Create:Source Code and Verify:Runner. To enable collaboration we may work together with other internal stakeholders on a single MR to update or create a feature and documentation. https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/76253 is an example of how this can work very well. E2E Tests Whenever possible, engineers should add all relevant tests alongside a new feature or a bug fix. It is always required that engineers should add all relevant tests (unit, component, integration or E2E) alongside a new feature or a bug fix. We recognize, however, that in the case of creating E2E tests this cannot be applied systematically for multiple reasons. This section lists some ways we work to deliver tests in a painless and efficient way. Plan ahead We aim to define needed tests early with Quad-planning. All the testing should be defined before the implementation starts and all parties should agree on: What type of test coverage is needed. Who is the DRI for which test. What is to be delivered. When it will be delivered. If Feature flag is required consider strategy for testing feature flags in end to end tests E2E tests are written in parallel When writing a new feature, we might need to write new E2E specs. In Pipeline Execution, we prefer to add E2E tests in separate MRs, the same way we prefer frontend and backend MRs to be separate. During Quad-planning, it is essential to determine whether that separate MR is required for the feature to ship or not. Given that we use feature flags for all new features, it is quite easy to work in separate MRs and turn on the flag when the team feels the feature has enough coverage for production use. A typical full stack feature can therefore involve multiple backend MRs, then frontend MRs, and finally E2E test MRs. Best person for the job Writing tests is a team effort and should never be delegated to a single group. We are all responsible for quality. That being said, we acknowledge that Software Engineers in Tests (SETs) have the most knowledge about writing E2E tests. A benefit of splitting the E2E specs into a separate MR is that it can be assigned to someone other than the DRI of the feature, which lets a more appropriate person write the spec. This can be the SET, backend or frontend, depending on the circumstances. Given the Ruby expertise required to write E2E tests, we should have SETs and backend engineers be the primary team members to write them. Frontend engineer may volunteer to write them with the support of a SET if they feel confident, but it is not expected of them. Whenever possible, backend engineers should help write the E2E tests of a new feature or bug fix. They should feel comfortable pinging the SET on their team as needed (to review the MR, for example). This helps alleviate the SET’s workload, so that they are not entirely responsible for E2E tests on their own. However when they are not comfortable writing the required E2E tests, then the plan should be for the SET to lead the effort. The rationale being that SETs have the most context and work daily with specs, so they will be able to write them much faster. More importantly, they can write much better specs. DRI engineers should proactively help the SET understand the required tests. Accounting for capacity In the instance where the SET has too many E2E tests to write, then they should check with backend engineers of the team if they could lead the effort on some of them. Because testing is part of the required work, we should account for E2E tests when assigning issues to a milestone. Bug fixes that require additional test coverage When we fix a bug, we ideally want to write a test that would catch and prevent this bug from happening again in the future. However, if the spec we need to write (unit, integration, or E2E test), is part of",

    "content": "on their team as needed (to review the MR, for example). This helps alleviate the SET’s workload, so that they are not entirely responsible for E2E tests on their own. However when they are not comfortable writing the required E2E tests, then the plan should be for the SET to lead the effort. The rationale being that SETs have the most context and work daily with specs, so they will be able to write them much faster. More importantly, they can write much better specs. DRI engineers should proactively help the SET understand the required tests. Accounting for capacity In the instance where the SET has too many E2E tests to write, then they should check with backend engineers of the team if they could lead the effort on some of them. Because testing is part of the required work, we should account for E2E tests when assigning issues to a milestone. Bug fixes that require additional test coverage When we fix a bug, we ideally want to write a test that would catch and prevent this bug from happening again in the future. However, if the spec we need to write (unit, integration, or E2E test), is part of a code change that needs to be merged as soon as possible (e.g. requires a time sensitive resolution), it is preferable to merge the fix first, and create an issue to write the spec afterwards, so that it is not blocking merging of the MR. This example should be considered the exception, not the rule. Creating follow-up issues for specs When creating follow-up issues for tests, we have to ensure that they are not going to sit on a pile in the backlog. Tests are essential and should be prioritized as such. When creating a follow-up issue for required tests: Make sure to assign the issue to the following milestone and make room for it to be worked on. Add all the context necessary to test the feature in the description, for example: Where it is, how it works, how to configure it, etc. Assign a DRI immediately and cc the product manager so that they are aware of the issue and required work. Bugs As a group, we strive to meet the Severity Service Level Objective of bugs. We regularly review all bugs and prioritize issues with a ~missed-SLO label and those approaching SLO (Service Level Objective) through our weekly Triage Report. One of the group’s goals is to reduce the median age of open S2 bugs which is being tracked by the Quality department as a KPI. To do this we will triage aged bugs each milestone closing what we can, reducing severity for bugs mis-labeled, asking for more details for issues that cannot be reproduced and prioritizing those that can be reproduced focusing on bugs in the identified JTBD. Features When we build new features, in line with our Iteration value, we aim for an MVC that covers the core aspect of the feature. Then we create issues with ~feature::enhancement label to iterate on the remaining functionality. The more a new feature is used, the more missing functionality eventually can be perceived as bugs by the users. We use severity::1, severity::2, severity::3 and severity::4 labels with ~feature::enhancement to classify the impact of those issues to prevent them from becoming ~type::bug. We use the list below as a guideline to grade the impact. Label Definition Description severity::1 Blocking or Critical The enhancement is critical to the core of the feature. The feature is currently incomplete or extra action is required. severity::2 High Some important aspects of the feature are missing but the feature delivers value. However the missing behavior can make the feature appear buggy. severity::3 Medium The feature works ok but the enhancement is required under less common scenarios. severity::4 Low The feature works fine and the improvement aims to improve customer satisfaction. Technical debt We track our technical debt using the following Pipeline Execution Technical Debt issue board, where we track issues in the planning phase. This board has 2 main sections: Issue readiness In workflow::planning breakdown we find issues that are currently being refined. In workflow::ready for development we find issues that clearly defined and a weight has been assigned. Impact breakdown. We use severity::1, severity::2, severity::3 and severity::4 labels to classify the impact of the specific tech debt item. We use the list below as a guideline to grade the impact. severity::1 Blocking or Critical blocking debt that prevents any further changes in the area we stumble on the same complex code every single time and it causes serious slow down on development the problem exists in a core part of our domain that represents a dependency for a large number of features the problem is wide spread throughout several domains the problem is related to a number of reported severity::1 bugs severity::2 High blocks many changes in the area or makes them difficult to work around it the problem exists in an area that changes frequently, causing it or workarounds to spread easily the problem is related to an important feature (e.g multi-project pipelines) the problem is very common in a specific domain and leaks into other domains too the problem is related to a number of reported severity::2 bugs severity::3 Medium the problem exists in a feature that has a supporting role in our domain the problem exists in an area that does not change frequently the problem is very common in a specific domain but limited to its domain boundaries workarounds slow down development the problem is related to a number of reported severity::3 bugs severity::4 Low the problem is very isolated and has low or no impact to development the area affected does not change frequently the problem is related to a number of reported severity::4 bugs Issue scheduling. The Engineering Manager(s) will review the PE Technical Debt issue board and recommend issues to schedule for upcoming milestones by adding them to the planning issue for a milestone or communicating",

The Engineering Manager(s) will review the PE Technical Debt issue board and recommend issues to schedule for upcoming milestones by adding them to the planning issue for a milestone or communicating with Product a need to schedule the issue in an upcoming milestone. The team strives to have 20% of a sprint’s capacity filled with Tech Debt issues. Note that multiple factors can exist at once. In that case use your judgment to either bump the impact score or lower it. For example: The problem exists in a feature that has a supporting role in our domain but it’s related to a number of severity::2 bugs. Then choose severity::2. The problem is related to an important feature but the workaround is acceptable as the code around it does not change frequently. Then choose severity::3. Risk Mapping To better understand the risk environment and each risk’s causes and consequences, the Pipeline Execution team uses the Risk Map as our risk management tool to prioritise mitigation strategies and increase Quality. Retrospectives The team uses a monthly async retrospective process as a way to celebrate success and look for ways to improve. The process for these retrospectives aligns with the automated retrospective process used by many teams at GitLab. A new retrospective issue is created on the 27th of each month, and remains open until the 26th of the following month. Team members are encouraged to add comments to that issue throughout the month as things arise as a way to capture topics as they happen. On the 16th of each month a summary of the milestone will be added to the issue and the team will be notified to add any additional comments to the issue. As comments are added to the issue, team members are encourage to upvote any comments they feel are important to callout, and to add any additional discussion points as comments to the original thread. Around the 26th of the month, or after the discussions have wrapped up the backend engineering manager will summarize the retrospective and create issues for any follow up action items that need to be addressed. They will also redact any personal information, customer names, or any other notes the team would like to keep private. Once that has been completed the issue will be made non-confidential and closed. Team Communication The team is globally distributed and separated by many timezones. This presents some challenges in how we communicate since our work days only overlap by a couple hours. We have decided as a team to embrace asynchronous communication because scheduling meetings is difficult to coordinate. We meet as a team one day per week, on Wednesdays for a team meeting and our team’s Engineering Managers schedule regular 1-on-1s. We are pro-active about asking questions in advance with the understanding that the turnaround on receiving an answer is usually 1-2 working days, subject to one’s workload. Our engineering plan and issue boards need to be updated regularly to communicate what stage our work is in. Any meetings that we hold need a preset agenda and are recorded for folks who are unable to attend. Having a positive work/life balance, despite these challenges, must be a high priority and handled intentionally so no one is routinely starting early or staying late to attend meetings. How to work with us Slack Daily standup updates are posted to g_pipeline-execution. Feel free to ask us questions directly in this Slack channel and someone will likely get back to you in 1-2 working days. We will use following emojis to respond to the posted question accordingly: - :eyes: to indicate that one of us has seen it – :white_check_mark: to indicate that the question has been answered The verify stage has a separate Slack channel under #s_verify, which encompasses the other groups of Verify. GitLab Issues and MRs Most spontaneous team communiation happens in issues and MRs. Our issues have a group label of [ #group:pipeline execution](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/issues?label_name%5B%5D=group%3A%3Apipeline+execution&scope=all', gitlab_subgroup: ‘pipeline-execution-group). You can also tag a team member with @mention in the issue if you have someone specific to ask. If you need to call the attention of the entire group, you can tag @gitlab-com/<%= gitlab_subgroup %>.

Please use #doe-ops or other public channels for topics that don’t require confidentiality. Meetings Zoom Recordings synced to Google Drive GitLab encourages transparency by default, and when meetings are recorded, they can be automatically synced to Google Drive as highlighted in the section about how we conduct video calls at GitLab. To summarize: Record meetings to the cloud in Zoom, and add the text [REC] anywhere in the meeting title (e.g. Google calendar event) It will automatically be added to the GitLab Videos Recorded folder on Google Drive, with a naming convention of youremail-Meeting Title. After a meeting ends, Zoom may take some time to process the recording before it is actually available. The sync to Google Drive happens on the hour mark, so if the recording is not available, it may take another hour to be transferred. Future recordings of recurring meetings can be found in the same folder youremail-Meeting Title, even if alternate hosts start the recording. Ops Engineering Showcase Starting in 2023 in FY24-Q1, a fresh new format for this showcase will include the recording and sharing of videos that team members have created. Once a video has been created, an async discussion issue should be created using this template and listed under the relevant quarterly epic. Based on the amount of questions being discussed in the issue, an AMA may be set up to discuss further in a group setting. Like before, these videos are intended to be opportunities for engineers to show off the things they’ve been working on. Beginning in March 2023 all Ops teams are required to provide at least one showcase video and async discussion issue per month. We require participation in this process because it helps reinforce our values of Results, Transparency, and Iteration. In addition, these showcases are valuable in helping team members across the company better understand the progress and obstacles across the many product areas Ops team members are focused on. They are also fun to watch. These videos will be reviewed monthly by the Director of Engineering and other leaders in the group. The team’s Engineering Manager is the DRI for submitting the showcase, though in many cases the demo may be delegated to another member of the team. Team members are encouraged to use these videos to transparently showcase the current state of their projects. It is not encouraged to spend significant time prepping for these demos or only showcase finished, polished functionality; showing functionality in an incomplete state is encouraged. Videos may be specifically recorded for this purpose or be excerpts from team meetings, etc. Some suggested ideas to consider could be related to error budget improvements, performance improvements to current features, refactoring to codebase for future maintainability, etc. Ops Engineering Showcases Recordings Past Recordings Quarterly Recordings NOTE: - changed to monthly recordings in FY24-Q3.

An example of this are security issues, here’s a dashboard for past due and soon to be due security issues: https://10az.online.tableau.com/t/gitlab/views/DRAFTIssueTypesDetail/PastDueIssueList/d1401498-2050-4321-b0f4-ab51047fbeb1/1909fa14-fdf0-4682-8a07-f02d8c8d4803 With this in mind, here’s a process that groups are encouraged to use and iterate on in the event that they don’t have an existing approach or are falling behind on SLA/SLOs. To be clear, this is not a required process, if your group’s approach is working, please continue with that! Ownership of scheduling forced priority work falls on our whole team, not a particular person. When forced priority issues are assigned to your group, schedule those issues right away regardless of severity label Have the team review the issue to make sure there’s a viable solution and plan (weight the issue) Have someone in the group assign themselves to work on the issue Update the issue regularly with progress Treat blockers with the same or higher priority than the original issue Sustaining / Non-Sustaining planning exercise In FY23, each EM in Ops was asked to participate in a capacity planning exercise that involved evaluating the sustaining vs non-sustaining work in their team’s backlog. This exercise was also repeated by the Verify Pipeline teams in FY24 to better understand Engineering capacity needs for each of the Pipeline teams. Each team created a staffing justification based on the breakdown of sustaining vs non-sustaining issues in their backlog. EMs estimated the number of backend engineers and frontend engineers that would be needed, per quarter, of the given fiscal year to burndown these issues, as ordered by the prioritization framework and relevant priority/severity labels. Sustaining work Sustaining work refers to the most important security, availability, scalability and performance, essential for “keeping the lights on” for the feature categories the team supports. Capacity planning for sustaining work was based on meeting the SLO/SLAs of these types of issues. The labels for sustaining work include, but are not limited to: bug::vulnerability (note: specifically this label, as an issue with only a security label does not make it a security vulnerability) bug::availability bug::performance infradev Non-Sustaining work Non-sustaining effort refers to all other work the teams would work on, including: type::feature type::maintenance (e.g. technical debt that does not impact availability, scalability, performance, etc) all other type::bug issues not covered as sustaining work reviewing community contributions responding to customer inquiries / support requests Ops Promotion Process Tips for writing Promotion Documents The format and guidelines are as listed in this Google Doc template Results is our most important value to cover in promotion docs, especially at Staff+ levels. This should be short (making it succinct can be easier to understand), but descriptive enough to show the impact these results have had. Impact should also be highlighted (quantifiable where possible), with examples such as: customer-facing impact (CMAU, ARR growth, retention, adoption, etc) improvements in efficiency, team process or other team metrics Examples demonstrating leadership, ownership and accountability (going above and beyond for your current role): Your role on a project or initiative (“how did you successfully help deliver X?”, “what role did you play in this Working Group?”) MR Review efforts (your role as a maintainer for your team or for the rest of the department in your domain) Collaborating with your team’s stable counterparts Mentoring/coaching others on your team or outside your team (e.g. participation in mentorship programs, coaching in MRs as a reviewer/maintainer) Influencing your team’s technical direction or contributions to more strategic discussions For Staff+ engineers: this could mean authoring or contributing to architectural design documents or leading technical discussions with your team or driving cross-stage collaboration Involvement in recruiting efforts (e.g. as an interviewer and/or reviewer of the technical assessment) Examples of promotion documents from previously approved Ops promotions can be found in this Google Drive folder Promotion Document Reviews Team Member and Manager work together to create promotion document. Promotion document is shared with Ops Sub-Department managers in #ops-staff-confidential channel (private to Ops Managers, Senior Managers, Director) to receive feedback on the document content and how it calibrates with others in the Sub-Department. This can be done early and often. Manager requests another Manager in the Sub-Department review and approve the document. Manager requests Senior Manager in the Sub-Department review and approve the document. Manager requests Director add Team Member to list of Sub-Department planned promotions. If the team member cannot be added Director will provide feedback to Manager as to why. Director presents promotion doc at Development Department quarterly promotion review meeting. If the promotion is not approved Director will provide feedback to Manager as to why. Quarterly Promotion Review Meeting Ops Managers, Sr. Managers, and Directors meet in the last month of each quarter to: Review promotion projections for each group. Managers add a list of their direct reports who they anticipate will be ready for promotion in the next 3 quarters to the meeting agenda. Note these lists may change and are not a guarantee a team member will be promoted in a specific quarter. The lists are used for planning purposes, to help us anticipate the number of team members approaching promotion, budget impact, and to support calibration across the group. These lists should include: Team Member name Targeted promotion quarter",

These lists should include: Team Member name Targeted promotion quarter Link to promotion doc Whether the doc has received any Ops Manager or Ops Senior Manager approvals. Review Ops team member promotion docs planned to be presented at Development Department quarterly promotion review meeting. Promotion Mentor for Staff+ Roles Team members who aspire to advance within our organization are advised to identify a mentor in the targeted role, and reach out to them about a mentorship. Involving a mentor in the peer promotion review process is beneficial, as it ensures: The feedback is informed by comprehensive understanding and relevance to the individual’s development. The feedback, being familiar and constructive, will not catch the mentee off guard and will provide clear directions for improvement from peers they’d work with directly. Individuals pursuing promotion, possibly in consultation with their managers, should maintain regular communication with their mentor to evaluate progress and explore further opportunities for growth. This initiative also aims to cultivate leadership qualities among our senior Staff+ engineers. We plan to trial this optional process in Ops during Q1FY25. Progress and established mentor/mentee pairs can be found in this epic Ops Hiring process We have limited capacity in the recruiting team so hiring managers are experimenting with the Ops Hiring process. We also hold a weekly hiring manager sync meeting (see Meetings section). Objectives & Key Results (OKRs) Creating OKRs Target a 70% completion rate for OKRs so that we are setting goals ambitiously. They should be challenging enough that accomplishing 100% is a stretch goal,since GitLab considers OKRs to be stretch goals by default. If your OKRs are associated with any specific types of issues, consider reviewing the prioritization framework, and align with your team on your OKRs priority relative to one another (for example, OKRs with issues with “forced prioritization”) and be clear on planning of the associated work over the quarter. Ensure Key Results (KRs) are measurable, by specifying a number (% or unit) as the target. Be clear on the starting number, and the expected end result (e.g. from x to y). Ideally create no more than 9 KRs per quarter, ideally with approximately 3 KR per objective. Tracking and completing OKRs Tracking quarterly OKRs for Ops Engineering groups. DRIs are expected to score OKRs on a regular basis, at least monthly, if possible. At the end of the quarter, DRIs can add a retrospective as a comment to reflect on the progress of their KR, in the following format: **Good** - Things that went well... **Bad** - Things that didn't go so well... **Try** - What might you do differently next time?

Updates to the plan should be made weekly, marking weekly items done and making updates based on current information. Authors should merge updates to their project plans without review/approval. We expect the use of project plans to reduce the amount of EM reporting by serving as a SSOT for project execution planning. For example this info no longer needs to be included in async updates (replace with a link to project plan). Key Project Review Meetings We hold periodic sync meetings to review key projects and collaborate on the plans for these important deliverables. Key Project DRIs should prepare for the meeting by creating a Key Project Review Prep Issue. This should be completed and shared at least 48 hours in advance of the meeting to allow time for other team members to review the content. The objective is to keep these meetings focused on execution, technical planning, and accountability within the Engineering group. These are open to anyone who wishes to attend. When it’s necessary to involve a broader group in some cases, we can plan additional follow ups case by case. We aim to meet synchronously where possible given the benefits of being able to talk through the project in a higher bandwidth context. Rescheduling is preferred if the proposed dates are not feasible for attendees. We could re-evaluate whether we can achieve the same goals with async after we have more experience running the process. The focus of the meeting time will be on topics such as: Do we all understand the goals, plan, and timeline? Obstacles/risks and mitigation plans Unmet dependencies Staffing levels Competing priorities How to unblock and/or accelerate Recognizing progress and key team member contributions Async Updates (No Status In Meetings) We have a policy in Ops to keep status updates out of meetings. Instead of reporting on status in meetings Directors, Senior Engineering Managers, Engineering Managers and Principal Engineers provide regular async updates. The content of these updates varies by individual and role: Async Update Guidance Engineering Manager Cadence: Weekly to Monthly (Optional) Topics: Highlights & Accomplishments Team Projects & Priorities (progress, blockers, key decisions, etc.) What’s next - what to expect in next update Senior Engineering Manager Cadence: Monthly (Optional) Topics: Milestone Review Allocation of focus in milestone plans (major features, maintenance, etc.) What tradeoffs or decisions should be made prior to Milestone kickoff? For example: Is the team overcommitted? Does the allocation of effort need to shift to meet specific goals? (e.g. Security SLAs) Principal Engineer Cadence: Weekly (Optional) Topics: Highlights & Accomplishments Projects & Priorities (progress, blockers, key decisions, etc.) To create a weekly async update Create a GitLab issue in any project. Apply the label ~OpsSection::AsyncUpdate. (The label ~OpsSection::Weekly-Update can also be used for backwards compatibility reasons.) Choose a descriptive title. Include your update in the issue description. To HIGHLIGHT an item for broader sharing Begin any paragraph in your update with the text HIGHLIGHT: These paragraphs will automatically be copied into the Highlights & Accomplishments section of the monthly Director’s update. To review Ops weekly async updates All issues with the ~OpsSection::AsyncUpdate or ~OpsSection::Weekly-Update label are summarized in weekly issues in the Ops Status Updates project. All team members are encouraged to comment and ask questions in weekly async update issues. This provides useful feedback to the author and opportunities to collaborate. Director reviews all updates weekly (from the prior week) and provides feedback. Senior EMs reviews all updates from their teams weekly (from the prior week) and provides feedback. Benefits of reporting and reviewing status async vs. synchronously in meetings Collaboration - By sharing announcements, achievements, goals, and plans we are empowering team members with the information they need to make sound decisions and succeed in their roles. Results - Async updates provide an important channel for sharing accomplishments and progress. Efficiency - Expecting each team member to poll for the status they need is extremely inefficient and becomes more inefficient as the organization grows. By using a Publish Subscribe model we are able to share information much more efficiently. Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging - Async status is more inclusive of team members across timezones. Not every team member will be able to make a sync meeting (due to timezone or other factors) but everyone can participate in an async update. Iteration - Taking the time to checkpoint where we are at each week prompts the author and readers to consider ways to iterate and to reflect on incremental progress. Transparency - Sharing information in a consistent, accessible way increases transparency and reduces the threshold for team members to contribute. Escalations from Support Team We are piloting a process to make coordinating with the Support team on customer escalations more efficient.

Supporting Customers on Dedicated instances When teams are asked to triage support requests for customers on GitLab Dedicated and engineers need access to their logs, a sync can be arranged between the engineer and the assigned Support Engineer for a screen sharing session. However, when further troubleshooting is needed by the engineering team or async collaboration is preferred, follow these steps to request access: Create an access request (AR) and list the engineers who require access. (Note that EMs can create this issue and provide Manager Approval on behalf of the engineers) Assign the AR to the EM and PM of the Dedicated group for read-only log access. Reference the AR issue in the support tracker issue so that the Support Engineer is aware.

    "title": "Office of the CEO | The GitLab Handbook",
    "content": "Office of the CEO Details about Office of the CEO (OCEO) at GitLab Office of the CEO Overview GitLab is a functionally organized company in which functions are as mutually exclusive as possible to be efficient. Without a COO or central operating department reporting into the CEO, the CEO gets leverage through an Office of the CEO (OCEO for short) led by the Chief of Staff (CoS) to the CEO. While the Chief of Staff to the CEO is not a part of GitLab’s executive team, this senior person reports directly to the CEO and manages a team that supports the CEO and/or cross-functional projects of importance to GitLab. Team Mission Help the CEO be more effective and lead select cross-functional initiatives of importance to GitLab. Team Composition The Office to the CEO consists of: The Chief of Staff to the CEO: the person responsible for running this group and supporting the success of the CEO. Strategy and Operations team members: internal consultants and doers who support priority cross-functional projects within GitLab. Roles vary based on business needs, but these folks can be specialists (for example, focused on China or technology) or generalists. When there are gaps, the Office may expand to include additional roles and responsibilities. For example, at times this Office has included our TeamOps initiative, internal communications, and handbook maintenance. As GitLab is a functionally organized company, the goal in most cases is to own an area until another function is prepared to own and support it. The size of the team and which positions are present have varied over time depending on CEO priorities and required resources. For a list of current OCEO team members, please refer to the company team page. Kinds of projects Strategy and Operations team members work on Given the cross-functional nature of the company goals and given these projects are important to the CEO, the Strategy and Operators team members are often involved in these initiatives. Project Criteria The Chief of Staff to the CEO and their team may work on projects that fit any combination of the following: projects which build or improve organizational design, infrastructure, and operations cross-functional projects that need ownership until a maintainer or exit criteria is identified projects that are so broad that they can’t live within a function but are too much work for the CEO or Chief of Staff to the CEO projects that are important to the CEO This is not an exhaustive list of the types of work the Office of the CEO might do. Many Functional GitLab is a functional organization, which means the people are organized by function. When a cross-functional project arises between multiple different Departments, Office of the CEO team members may be included to help with the planning and execution. In many cases, a member of the Office of the CEO will be the directly responsible individual (DRI) for the project. Whether it’s a product feature proposal, a new initiative roll-out, or questions from the board, the Office of the CEO is the group that can be trusted to get things done, get them done quickly, and get them done right. Examples of a cross-functional project: Helping shepherd KPI and/or OKR progress Helping to launch a foreign entity Supporting pricing and packaging change initiatives Efforts to increase customer use case adoption Providing guidance around how to use GitLab’s internal handbook Under-resourced Projects come up that are both important and under-resourced. The Strategy and Operations team members within the Office of the CEO should be known for its ability to become 80% effective on any subject quickly. They are generalists at their core and, while they bring special skills to the table, they are meant to be able to address important problems as they come up. A member of the Office of the CEO might help source candidates for a strategic hire, fix grammatical errors in the handbook, and build a financial model all in the same day based on what is important or top of mind for the CEO at a given point. The team helps with work that other teams may not have the bandwidth to do but is important to the organization and/or the CEO. Examples of an under-resourced project: Creating materials for a keynote the CEO will deliver in a rushed timeline Supporting planning for a global conference Supporting launch of a new SKU No clear leader There may be projects with no clear leader for a myriad of reasons, including that we’re still hiring the point person or the lead is on leave. Because of the team’s ability to come up to speed quickly, they may be tasked with something totally out of their domain with the expectation that they bring their leadership experience to the table, will do the work to make good decisions, and will lean on team members who are subject-matter experts. For example, there has historically been no DRI for the handbook or related content sites. As it became clear that this was a GitLab priority, but no function planned to prioritize this within the coming year, the Office of the CEO stepped in to take on handbook ownership until an owner could be identified. Examples of projects with no clear leader: Managing our ongoing relationship with JiHu in China Stepping in to fill a senior level role in another function in a temporary capacity Broad Some projects or initiatives are very broad and cross-functional and make sense to belong to the CEO but would be inefficient uses of the CEO’s time if fully owned by the CEO. The Office of the CEO is the shepherd for these sorts of projects and collaborates with all team members at GitLab to achieve success on such initiatives. Examples of broad projects: E-group offsite prep Board meeting prep OKR shepherding Planning activities on behalf of the CEO Important to the CEO The CEO will have other projects that come up that they will task the Office of the CEO with, such as",

    "content": "good decisions, and will lean on team members who are subject-matter experts. For example, there has historically been no DRI for the handbook or related content sites. As it became clear that this was a GitLab priority, but no function planned to prioritize this within the coming year, the Office of the CEO stepped in to take on handbook ownership until an owner could be identified. Examples of projects with no clear leader: Managing our ongoing relationship with JiHu in China Stepping in to fill a senior level role in another function in a temporary capacity Broad Some projects or initiatives are very broad and cross-functional and make sense to belong to the CEO but would be inefficient uses of the CEO’s time if fully owned by the CEO. The Office of the CEO is the shepherd for these sorts of projects and collaborates with all team members at GitLab to achieve success on such initiatives. Examples of broad projects: E-group offsite prep Board meeting prep OKR shepherding Planning activities on behalf of the CEO Important to the CEO The CEO will have other projects that come up that they will task the Office of the CEO with, such as following up on something or carrying on a conversation on their behalf. Examples of tasks or initiatives that are important to the CEO: Handbook MRs Values updates Preparing for calls Special projects. These have included: Operationalizing charitable donations Supporting updates to GitLab’s expense policy Quantifying the value of transparency Auditing training resources and creating an accessible source of truth Calculating GitLab’s carbon emissions and leading a first iteration of a carbon reduction initiative Identifying the underlying reasons for why we didn’t meet targets for a core GTM KPI and identifying optimizations Supporting an initiative to increase customer CI adoption Serving as the DRI for the SaaS free user initiative How to Work Many of the tasks are quick asks: handbook MRs, formatting changes, or questions to be answered. Small asks should be handled as quickly as possible. Other asks, such as OKR-related planning or an initiative that requires alignment with multiple stakeholders, require forethought and more appropriate timing. Some amount of time each week needs to be spent moving these sorts of tasks forward. As a rule, everything in the doc is a TODO for the Office of the CEO. When tasks are DONE, they should be labeled as such. The CEO will review and delete the item once it’s been assessed as completed. Prioritization Since the team has limited capacity to lean into everything that it may want or be asked to, it is thoughtful about team and individual capacity. Members of the Office of the CEO will be expected to manage both directed and leadership (largely self-directed) work. You can find definitions and examples of directed and leadership work on the CoS to the CEO handbook page. When newly initiated, self-directed, leadership work entails a significant time commitment (>20% capacity for more than a week), the work being done should be flagged to the CEO in a 1:1 or team meeting. This work should stay on the 1:1 agenda between the CoS to the CEO and the team member for the duration of the activity. If needed, activities may be reprioritized based on top demands and priorities. More senior roles within the Office of the CEO can expect to have more leadership than directed work, but all roles should have a mix within a fiscal year. Office of the CEO members should monitor the mix of directed and leadership work that they are doing and provide as appropriate in Office of the CEO Meetings, so the CoS to the CEO and CEO are aware of the current balance and can make adjustments, if needed. Collaborating on Cross-Functional Initiatives While there are rare exceptions, members of the Office of the CEO are not forever owners of initiatives. They plug in to help achieve critical milestones or fill gaps. When a member of the Office of the CEO joins an initiative, there should be agreement from key stakeholders around: The level of support required The Office of the CEO members’ scope and responsibilities The exit criteria for the Office of the CEO If required, the long-term plan for ongoing initiative or project support Office of the CEO members can be reassigned based on the needs of the business and priorities of the CEO. In most cases, a member of the Office of the CEO will remain with a project until the exit criteria for the Office of the CEO is achieved. If a project extends beyond its anticipated timeframe or priorities change, a member may have to leave a project before the agreed upon exit criteria is achieved. When a member of the Office of the CEO exits an ongoing initiative they will: Provide as much notice as possible that the Office of the CEO will no longer support the initiative Document their key responsibilities Support a project DRI in identifying new owners When possible, stay engaged in the initiative in a limited capacity during an agreed upon transition period There may be instances in which the Office of the CEO leaving leads to a project scope being reduced or deprioritized. In these instances, the Office of the CEO member will be responsible for engaging key stakeholders around the keep/expand scope or go/no-go decision. It will be clearly documented and key folks will be involved in the decision and aware of the outcome. E-Group Offsite The executives get together every quarter for the e-group offsite. The CoS to the CEO plays an important role. It’s 3 to 4 days long with a Functional Leaders Meeting within the following days. There are recurring discussion topics as well as a discussion on content chosen by the CEO. In addition, the CoS to the CEO is responsible for preparing the CEO for offsites by: Finalizing the agenda to include CEO input Working with the CEO on what to cover in offsite introductions and",

The CoS to the CEO enables and manages this group. Program managing JiHu A member of the Office of the CEO is the DRI within GitLab for the success of GitLab’s partnership with JiHu. Coordination with JiHu requires engagement from multiple functions within GitLab. The Office of the CEO ensures that the appropriate folks are engaged at the right times and that GitLab provides appropriate support to this separate entity. For example, this member ensures that there is an aligned process among relevant GitLab functions after a customer requests to transit to JiHu: After the Customer’s request of novation from GitLab to JiHu is approved, the member of the Office of the CEO opens a new issue as soon as the contract is issued, and assigns the issue to GitLab Accounting department. This issue triggers the Accounting development to update SFDC, Zuora and NS. If there is no issue raised in the month, it means there is no novation in that month. This process takes effects from 2023-02-01, and replaces the previous process that an issue is created each month regardless whether there is novation in the month or not. Organizational pulse Due to its cross-functional scope and access to information, the Office of the CEO is uniquely positioned to see what is happening across the company. Members of the Office of the CEO are encouraged to regularly have coffee chats with folks outside of the team and share key insights and feedback from these conversations. Measuring results We are evaluating different ways to measure our success as a team. These include: A company-wide team satisfaction score A pulse survey sent to a few targeted folks who have worked closely with the Office of the CEO team members in the past quarter Score against team quarterly goals Score on success in a few top initiatives within a quarter Chief of Staff Shadow The Chief of Staff to the CEO may occasionally have a Chief of Staff Shadow, a GitLab team member who will participate in a specific project or initiative for a fixed time. Depending on the project or initiative, the team member may spend most of their time with an Office of the CEO team member instead. Shadow responsibilities could include: taking notes, providing feedback, and/or supporting the overall initiative success. This role would be in addition to any existing responsibilities at GitLab. Participants would opt in to experience another function within GitLab and contribute to a different part of the business. Since participation would be in addition to an existing workload, managers must sign off before a CoS to the CEO Shadow can participate. Interested team members can share their interest with the Chief of Staff to the CEO in the #ceo-chief-of-staff-team Slack channel. The CoS to the CEO will follow up with you to understand what you are looking to get out of the experience and review projects that may be a good match. If there is not an existing project, you will be kept in mind for future opportunities. Once a project or initiative to Shadow has been identified and the team member decides to participate, the team member should open a merge request to add their name to the below table. The MR should be shared through Slack in the #ceo-chief-of-staff-team channel for review and merge. Optionally, the team member can make use of the internship for learning as a framework to guide the Shadow period.

    "title": "Internship for Learning | The GitLab Handbook",
    "content": "Internship for Learning Resources and direction for internship for learning for all GitLab team members If your manager has coverage, you can spend a percentage of your time working (through an ‘internship’) with another team. This could be for any reason: maybe you want to broaden your skills or maybe you’ve done that work before and find it interesting. If your team has someone working part-time on it, it’s on the manager of that team to ensure that the person has the support and training they need, so they don’t get stuck. Maybe that’s a buddy system, or maybe it’s just encouragement to use existing Slack channels - whatever works for the individuals involved. How does this work? What percentage of time should be allocated? Well, 10% time and 20% time are reasonably common. As long as you and your manager have the capacity the decision is theirs and yours. What about the team losing a person for X% of the time? How are they supposed to get work done? Each manager needs to manage the capacity of their team appropriately. If all of the team are ‘at work’ (no one is on PTO, or parental leave, or off sick), and the team still can’t afford X% of one person’s time - that team might be over capacity. Can I join a team where I have no experience or skills in that area? That’s up to the managers involved. It may be that the first step is to spend some time without producing anything in particular - in which case, it’s possible that the Growth and Development Fund may be a better fit (or it might not.) How long does an internship of this nature last? This will vary from team to team, but typically 6 weeks to 3 months depending on the goals for your internship. This sounds great but how do I initiate this process? First step is to discuss this with your manager at your next 1:1. Come prepared with your proposal highlighting what skills you want to learn/enhance and the amount of time you think you will need. Remember, this should be of benefit to you and GitLab. You and your manager will need to collaborate on how you both can make this happen which may also involve discussing it further with the manager of the team you may be looking to transfer to. All discussions will be done transparently with you. Be mindful though that the business needs may mean a move can’t happen immediately. How do I find a mentor? On the team page, you can see who is willing to be a mentor by looking at the associated expertise on their entry. Does completing an internship guarantee me a role on the team? Completing an internship through this program does not guarantee an internal transfer. For example, there may not be enough allocated headcount in the time-frame in which you complete your internship. If at the end of your internship, you are interested in transferring teams please follow the guidelines in Internal Department Transfers. Starting Your New Internship Please create a new issue in the Training project, choose the internship_for_learning template, and fill out the placeholders. No internship for learning should be approved without both managers having a conversation and agreeing upon the percentage of time the team member will be spending on the internship. In order to be eligible for an internship for learning, the team member needs to be meeting performance expectations in their current role. Once you’ve agreed upon the internship goals, both managers should inform their respective groups’ People Business Partner. Recommendations We recommend that, at any given time, each team is handling only one intern. This is to allow for an efficient and focused mentorship without impacting the capacity of the team. You can, of course, adjust this depending on the size of the team but please consider the impact of mentoring when scheduling internships.
